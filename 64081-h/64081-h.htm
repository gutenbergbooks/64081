<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br /><br />
MARIQUITA ESCUDERO.
</h3>

<p>
After the breathless calm of the past day, the heat
of the cabin was intense.  The lamp was trimmed
and lit by the steward, but the skylight was still
kept open.
</p>

<p>
"Awfully hot, Morley, is it not?" said Tom
Bartelot, as he threw off his jacket.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; and the heat makes one so thirsty, too!"
</p>

<p>
"I can't give you iced champagne, as in the
gardens at Rio; but the steward has bitter beer,
beaujolais, and potash water, with grog for you,
Morrison, which I know you prefer; and you, too,
Noah, my old Triton.  And now let us to work, and
overhaul the old man's papers."
</p>

<p>
Morrison, who had been scanning over the manuscript,
helped himself to a glass of grog mechanically,
without taking his eyes from the writing.  Noah
Gawthrop, who had been specially invited below, in
virtue of the part he had borne in the past day's
episode, received a jorum of stiff grog from the
steward, and seated himself near the bulkhead,
uncomfortably, on the extreme edge of a sea-chest,
in preference to the well-cushioned locker, which he
evidently considered too fine for his tarry trousers.
</p>

<p>
Morley and Bartelot were each furnished with a
glass of beaujolais and potash water.  The stars
were visible through the open skylight, paling away
into the blue ether overhead, when Morrison began
to read, translating the recluse's Spanish into
tolerable English, as he made himself master of the
subject; the sole interruptions, as he proceeded,
being an occasional interjection from Noah, such as
"Dash my buttons!" "Smite my timbers!" varied
by "Darn my eyes! the ragamuffin! the regular-built
old Bluebeard!" followed by a hard slap of
his hand upon his own thigh; though much of what
he heard proved a sore puzzle to him, especially the
religious invocations, the outbursts of remorse, and
bitter self-reproaches, which we omit in the rehearsal
of his story.
</p>

<p>
The manuscript proceeded thus:
</p>

<p>
"I pray the reader hereof, if he be a good Catholic,
to say a novena, or nine days' prayer, for the repose
of my sinful soul; and I beg of the first Christian
man who shall give my remains interment to place
a cross at the end of my grave.
</p>

<p>
"Let whoever beholds these poor remains profit
by the sad spectacle they exhibit, even as the recluse,
Brother Pedro, has sought to profit by the prayers,
penance, and mortification of twenty years spent in
this solitude, while striving to atone for the errors
of forty spent in the world as Don Pedro Zuares
Miguel de Barradas.
</p>

<p>
"I was a man of fortune in New Spain; my forefathers
were of the purest blood&mdash;the boasted blue
blood of those who dwelt by the Ebro, without taint
of Goth, of Moor, or Jew&mdash;and my more immediate
predecessors, men who came with Hernan Cortez, of
Medellin, and Francis Pizarro, of Troquillo, to
conquer the new world which Columbus had given to
Castile and Leon.
</p>

<p>
"My direct ancestor, Don Miguel de Barradas,
came from San Pedro de Arlanza, in the district of
Burgos.  A near kinsman of Hernan Cortez, he was
one of the first who settled on the table-land of
Anahuac, founding one of those powerful families
which flourish there, and who also possess all the
sea-coast, from La Vera Cruz to San Luis de Potosi.
</p>

<p>
"In power and right of action, we were free and
unfettered, as the Spanish nobility at home.  No
agrarian law could there force us to sell our vast
estates, if we neglected to cultivate them; and our
farmers we could harass, oppress, cajole, or expel
at our pleasure.
</p>

<p>
"Proud of my descent from one of those who
conquered Tlascala and Tenochtitlan in 1521, no
man was more vain of his old Castilian pedigree
than I; yet there came a time when I joined the
patriots, and fought for the separation of Peru from
the mother country, and, with my own blood, sought
to cement the foundation of the free United States
of South America.
</p>

<p>
"Prior to my entering upon that career of usefulness,
my objects in life were very different.
</p>

<p>
"I was possessed of vast wealth; I had been well
educated and highly accomplished by my parents, at
whose desire I had travelled over all Europe, and
had visited its capitals, to the improvement of my
taste, though but little to the advantage of my
morals.
</p>

<p>
"I was possessed of a person that was considered
handsome.  I deemed myself a model and mirror of
honour, and had a spirit ever high and haughty, but
at times crafty and ferocious.  My character was
full of inconsistencies; thus, wherever I went, I
became involved in quarrels on frivolous pretexts
and points of honour&mdash;quarrels, which invariably
ended in duels, and in these I was generally the
victor, whether with sword or with pistol, for I was
skilful in the use of both.
</p>

<p>
"Within this shadow was a darker shade!
</p>

<p>
"No man's wife or daughter&mdash;even were he my
best and dearest friend&mdash;could be safe from my
artful, insidious, and too often successful advances;
for to see any woman, possessed of even moderate
attractions, was to love her at once.
</p>

<p>
"Success in each instance gave new courage and
address, and led to success in others; thus my whole
time was spent in weaving plans and intrigues, and
the chief aim of my existence was to feel myself the
conqueror.  Thus to flame succeeded flame, so rapid
were my fancies, so insatiable my desires, that I
rejoiced in the idea of making three or four
assignations with as many different beauties in one day.
</p>

<p>
"Opposition in some, the tears, the reproaches,
and the despair of others, added but piquancy to
this pursuit of the innocent and unwary, while my
hand with the small sword was so skilful and steady,
my aim with the pistol so deadly and true, that
relations and rivals sought to punish me in vain,
though thrice I escaped miraculously their attempts
at deliberate assassination.
</p>

<p>
"Of all whom I deceived none do I mourn more
in this time of repentance and bitterness, than
Mariquita Escudero, whose image and memory fill me
yet&mdash;even at the distance of many years&mdash;with
inexpressible sorrow.
</p>

<p>
"She was the only daughter of Miguel Escudero,
a worthy old farmer of mine, near Orizaba&mdash;that
mighty volcano, whose summit is 1,300 feet higher
than the Peak of Teneriffe, and which serves as
a landmark to all mariners bound for La Vera
Cruz.
</p>

<p>
"Though tainted, as we deemed it, with the
Mexican blood of her mother, who was an octoroon
of a native tribe, Mariquita inherited from her father
good old Castilian blood, and was a girl far exceeding
all whom I had met or known in loveliness and
goodness, in virtue and in purity.
</p>

<p>
"She had heard of my evil reputation, and
warned by common rumour&mdash;it may be by her
parents, or inspired by native modesty&mdash;she always
drew her mantilla close, and shunned or avoided me,
when I visited Orizaba.
</p>

<p>
"Piqued by her coldness and inflamed by her
beauty, which was of a very remarkable kind, I
relinquished, or forgot for the time, every other
amour, to engage in this new one, proceeding to
work warily, and with all the subtlety of the fiend I
was then.
</p>

<p>
"Though I frequently visited the <i>granja</i> (farm)
of old Miguel Escudero, I ceased to notice, save by
a casual bow, the presence of Mariquita; but strove
assiduously to gain the friendship of her brother,
Juan, a handsome and high-spirited young man,
whom, as he was a deadly shot and good swordsman,
I thought it would be as well to remove from
the vicinity of my operations.
</p>

<p>
"I might easily have had him taken off, by
distributing a few dollars among the bandidos of the
Barranca Secca; but, though wicked enough, I was
not sufficiently a villain for that, and so preferred to
procure for him a commission as an <i>alferez</i> (ensign)
in the guards of the castle of San Juan de Ulloa, an
honour which, being so unusual, when conferred on
the son of a humble <i>grangero</i>, or farmer, filled the
soul of Miguel with gratitude, and Juan with pride
and joy.
</p>

<p>
"Not content with this, I appointed Escudero
overseer of all my estates, with an income of about
five hundred pistoles per annum; so my cold little
beauty, the Senora Mariquita, had now a horse and
mounted groom when she went abroad, instead of a
mule, as before, and a barefooted negro runner.
</p>

<p>
"These presents&mdash;this unwonted patronage&mdash;passed
well enough as rewards to an ancient and
faithful adherent of our house, for old Miguel
Escudero had been an especial confidant of my
father, and was descended from one of the twenty
men-at-arms whom my ancestor, Don Miguel, had
brought from San Pedro de Arlanza in Old Castile.
He regarded me with a friendship, a love, that was
almost paternal, and now pressed me to visit him
at the handsome residence which my favour and
bounty had conferred upon him; so I went to spend
three months under the same roof with Mariquita,
on the slopes of the vast Pic d'Orizaba, to hunt the
wild cattle, the elks, the buffaloes, and cabri, and
the grisly black bears, in the ever green forests and
lovely savannahs that spread away from thence
towards the Rio de Carraderas; and, nightly, it
was my joy to lay the spoils of the chase at the feet
of Mariquita, in compliment to her as the mistress
of her father's house, for such she was&mdash;luckily, for
the furtherance of my project, her watchful mother
having been recently removed by death.
</p>

<p>
"I now saw more of her than I could ever have
done by periodical visits, and my passion grew
greater by our intimacy, for the girl was a
wondrously lovely brunette, though her skin was
exceedingly fair.  The form of her hands and feet,
the contour of her head, and the soft luxuriant
masses of her ripply black hair, were all perfect;
and her eyes, large, dark, clear, and liquid, were
beautiful, and ever varying in expression.
</p>

<p>
"I was too artful, too well trained in the ways of
vice, to seem more than simply pleased with the
society of Mariquita.  I was scrupulously attentive
to her at table and elsewhere.  If she mounted, my
hand and knee were at her service; but when
dismounting, she always preferred the attendance of
her father, or her old negro groom, as if determined
that no hand of mine should ever touch her slender
waist.
</p>

<p>
"We occasionally accompanied each other on the
guitar.  Songs of love were long, long avoided, but
they came at last.  I remember the first we ventured
on&mdash;'Love's First Kiss,' an old song of Burgos,
beginning:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'A aquel caballero madre.'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And then came a time, too, when I saw that
Mariquita ceased to avoid me&mdash;a time when her
cheek flushed palpably, and when her lovely eyes
dilated and sparkled at my approach with emotions
of pleasure there were no concealing.
</p>

<p>
"In me she beheld her father's patron and benefactor,
her brother's friend; so gratitude soon led
the way to love.
</p>

<p>
"I beheld the growth of this secret influence
with exultation, yet never spoke of love.  Inspired
by my master, the devil, I was too wary yet to mar
my game until she loved me irretrievably and
deeply.  My efforts, my passion, were about to be
rewarded at last!
</p>

<p>
"For good or for evil, to what is a man most
indebted for success in life?  To genius, birth,
education, or perseverance?  To none of these, but
simply to success itself.
</p>

<p>
"Alas! she was too young, too tender, and too
artless&mdash;too full of keen Spanish and generous
Indian impulses, to withstand me; and after a time
I saw that she burned with a passion equal to my
own, which I still pretended to suppress within me,
and to veil under an outward aspect of indifference
and respect.
</p>

<p>
"'The first symptom of true love in a young man
is timidity; in a girl it is boldness,' says a writer.
'This will surprise, and yet nothing is more simple:
the two sexes have a tendency to approach, and
each assumes the qualities of the other.'
</p>

<p>
"This strange analysis of the human heart was
fully realised in the case of Mariquita.
</p>

<p>
"One day we were riding at the foot of the vast
Cordillera, through those odoriferous groves, the
leaves of which are used for perfuming the chocolate.
We had contrived to miss our black groom, who had
dismounted in a part of the wood, to examine a
shoe of his horse; so, as the atmosphere of noon
was intensely hot and breathless, we sought a shady
and sequestered spot, where, under the cool, humid,
and umbrageous forest leaves, the smilax or
sarsaparilla roots, the liquidambar, the choacun root,
and the balsam of tolu were growing in luxuriance,
and where the wild cotton tree, and the broad-leaved
tobacco plant, the yellow gourd, and the purple
grape, all formed a jungle together.
</p>

<p>
"Languid and panting with the heat of the day,
the length of our ride, and, inspired by the pleasure
she now felt in my society, Mariquita never looked
so lovely; and now, when praying that she would
alight, strange to say, I spoke timidly and with a
wildly-beating heart; but, to my surprise, she
consented, and held out her hand with a delightful
smile.
</p>

<p>
"As I lifted her from the saddle, she threw back
her long low veil, and the heavy masses of her
perfumed hair fell upon my cheek.
</p>

<p>
"She leant heavily forward in my arms, and,
instead of placing her on the ground, I pressed her
tenderly to my breast, with my lips trembling on
her forehead.  Then I murmured in her ear:
</p>

<p>
"'Mariquita, <i>mi querida</i>&mdash;Marguerita, my idol&mdash;I
love you&mdash;love you dearly!  Will you pardon me;
will you permit it?'
</p>

<p>
"She did not reply, but her head sank upon my
shoulder, for the crisis had come!  Her lovely face
was close to mine, and I felt her breath upon my
cheek.  The colour had left hers, for those emotions
which cause some women to blush make others grow
pale; but her half-closed eyes sparkled with passion
and joy under their long black lashes, and her rosy
lips were parted by a divine smile.
</p>

<p>
"I felt that I had triumphed; that Mariquita,
the once proud, cold, and reserved Mariquita, loved
me, for that emotion which had made me at first
seem timid now made her actually bold, and her
sweet lips sought mine, it may be but too readily, in
the first glow of her girlish ardour.
</p>

<p>
"She gave me one long and passionate kiss, and
then, without assistance, she sprang from my arms
to her saddle, saying, with mingled smiles and
tears:
</p>

<p>
"'We have both been foolish&mdash;very foolish,
Senor Don Pedro, but let us begone.'
</p>

<p>
"'Mariquita, consider the heat&mdash;your fatigue!' I
urged.
</p>

<p>
"'We are some miles from the <i>granja</i>, and have
first the road to find,' she replied hurriedly.
</p>

<p>
"With her horse's reins and her whip, she had
resumed something of her former self, but the
memory of my kisses yet burned upon her brow and
lips.  I endeavoured, in vain, to lead the conversation
back to the sudden impulse which the simple
act of dismounting had given to both our
hearts.
</p>

<p>
"I begged of her to moderate the pace of her
horse, as there was plenty of time for us to reach
home; but she would not listen to me, and seemed
to blush with anger now at the memory of what had
passed between us; yet little cared I for that,
felt assured that we had passed the Rubicon, that
this beautiful girl loved me, and that the time I
had spent with old Miguel Escudero, in rambling
among his plantations, where the negroes hoed the
sugar, planted tobacco, and gathered the cotton
tufts, had not been spent in vain.
</p>

<p>
"Mariquita did not avoid me, so for several days
after this I never missed an opportunity, especially
when old Senor Escudero was not present, of
pressing my suit, and giving her assurances of my
unalterable love!  Unalterable!  Oh, <i>mal hay as tu</i>,
Pedro de Barradas, into how many charming ears
had those same words been poured, and in the
same tender accents, too!
</p>

<p>
"But Mariquita, who had become more mistress
of herself, always heard me with composure, and
with a bearing unlike that she had exhibited in the
wood; but I could see that the simplest remark, or
most casual tone of my voice, made her heart vibrate
with pleasure, and her colour deepen.
</p>

<p>
"One evening we were standing together at an
open window, which was shaded by a vine-covered
verandah, and faced the usually flaming summit of
the volcano of Orizaba.  It was wonderfully still on
that occasion; a column of thin smoke only ascended
from it to the very zenith.  The evening was lovely,
and the sun's farewell rays were gilding the mighty
summit of the cone; all was calm and quiet, save in
our hearts, which beat tumultuously.  I drew closer
to Mariquita, and as she stood before me, I passed
my arms round her, kissed the back of her delicate
neck tenderly, and whispered:
</p>

<p>
"'How long shall I speak to you of love, Mariquita?'
</p>

<p>
"'As long as you please, Senor Don Pedro,' she
replied, with a tender smile, as she half turned
round her head.
</p>

<p>
"'Call me Pedro, my beloved one, without the
ceremonious don&mdash;and senor, too, oh, fie!'
</p>

<p>
"'<i>Bueno&mdash;Pedro mi querida.</i>'
</p>

<p>
"'Sweeter still!' I exclaimed, in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
"'Well?'
</p>

<p>
"'Well, dearest Mariquita; how long shall we
speak of love?'
</p>

<p>
"'As long as you please.'
</p>

<p>
"'Ah! feel how my heart beats.  I ask how
long in vain?'
</p>

<p>
"'Long enough, senor,' said she, with a pretty
pout.
</p>

<p>
"'<i>Senor!</i>'
</p>

<p>
"'Yes, senor, unless&mdash;unless&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
She paused.
</p>

<p>
"'What?'
</p>

<p>
"'You speak of marriage, too,' she replied,
suddenly unclasping my hands, which were tenderly
folded round her slender waist.
</p>

<p>
"'Do you love me?'
</p>

<p>
"'Do I love you?' she repeated, reproachfully,
turning her full, clear, and glorious eyes to mine,
while throwing back her veil and the masses of her
silky hair together; 'you know that <i>I do love you</i>,
Pedro, fondly, deeply, passionately, for you have
won that which never belonged, and never shall
belong, to another&mdash;my heart.'
</p>

<p>
"'Beloved Mariquita!' I exclaimed, and pressed
her to my breast in a long and mutual embrace,
'and you will be mine&mdash;mine?'
</p>

<p>
"'At the foot of the altar, Pedro&mdash;at the foot of
the altar alone,' she whispered, with a heart that
swelled with love, and with dark eyes steeped in
languor.
</p>

<p>
"But vain are human resolves, even when made
by a heart so pure and guileless as that of Mariquita,
when struggling with a passion so deep and
consuming; for with these very words on her lips she
was yielding; we were alone and undisturbed, and
ere the sun's last rays had faded from the cone of
Orizaba, Mariquita had lost her honour!
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
"The hapless Mariquita!  She loved me more
than ever now.  She clung to me with all the
strength of love, of sacrifice, and of despair.
</p>

<p>
"For days after this, on her knees, she besought
me to marry her.  I would raise her, kiss and
console her, and flatter, too&mdash;how weary now the
task!&mdash;flatter and pacify her, making countless promises
and professions, for I still loved her in my own
selfish fashion; but I shrunk from the idea of
marriage with the daughter of one of my own
grangeros&mdash;one whose ancestors had been hewers of
wood and drawers of water to mine&mdash;a girl, moreover,
who had the taint of native blood in her veins!
</p>

<p>
"I, Pedro de Barradas, Knight of Santiago de
Compostella, and Lord of Anahuac, whom the proud
daughters of the first men, and of the noblest
houses in New Spain, had failed to lure within the
meshes of matrimony, was not likely to mate with
the daughter of Miguel Escudero, however much I
might love her, and however much she might please
my somewhat fastidious eye.
</p>

<p>
"I heard her many tender and pathetic entreaties&mdash;and
once, too, her wild threats of self-destruction,
poniard in hand&mdash;that I would save her from
impending shame; but I was pitiless as the ocelot&mdash;the
tiger-cat that lurked in the woods of Orizaba&mdash;all
the more pitiless that I knew she fondly&mdash;yes,
madly&mdash;loved me.
</p>

<p>
"Weary of the endless task of seeking to console
one who would not and could not be consoled, I
quitted Orizaba for some months, as we were
planning the revolt against the mother country, a
movement which was to secure to me the captaincy of the
great castle of San Juan, de Ulloa, the citadel of
La Vera Cruz, which mounts nearly 200 pieces of
cannon, and is the key of the whole province.
</p>

<p>
"During my absence and in the fulness of time,
Mariquita had a son, born in secrecy, amid tears,
shame, and sorrow.  She baptised it by the name of
Pedro, and sent him to a lonely puebla in the
mountains that overlook the Barranca Secca, to be
nursed by one of my people.  This birth, all
unknown alike to Miguel Escudero, whom I had
despatched on a political mission towards the shores
of the Pacific, and to his son, Juan, who was now a
lieutenant of infantry at the castle of San Juan
de Ulloa.
</p>

<p>
"My passion for Mariquita still existed; her love
for me was greater than ever now, and she lived but
for me, and in the hope that in pity, if not for love,
I would espouse her still, and these hopes I was
always wicked enough to fan; 'so man wrongs, and
time avenges.'
</p>

<p>
"Completely in my power, surrounded by my
toils, the victim of my wiles, still loving me dearly
and desperately, and still hoping for the ultimate
fulfilment of my thousand protestations, the poor
girl continued to meet me from time to time in a
deserted sugar-mill on the mountains of Orizaba, a
secret intercourse that ended fatally for her and for
all, for another son, whom we named Zuares, was
born, and at the same time the whole affair came to
the knowledge of Miguel Escudero, who, though
but a humble grangero, had all the pride of birth,
and more than the ideas of spotless honour, honesty,
and female purity, possessed by any grandee of old
Castile.
</p>

<p>
"The poor old man's horror was beyond all description.
</p>

<p>
"To find that his daughter's honour had been
lost, his hospitality so infamously violated, his home
disgraced, his prospects ruined, and by me&mdash;ME,
whom he had so loved and so respected, as his friend
and benefactor, was a mortal stab too deep to
survive, and within an hour after the revelation
came upon him in all its stunning details, poor
Miguel Escudero had ceased to exist.
</p>

<p>
"He did not die by his own hand, he was too
good and too religious a man for such a terrible
act; but sinking on the floor of his chamber, he
never moved again.  He died of autopsy&mdash;paralysis
of the heart!
</p>

<p>
"I was not present at this scene of horror, being,
fortunately for myself, in command of the great
castle of San Juan de Ulloa.
</p>

<p>
"On the day of Corpus Christi, after having
attended mass, I was walking on that portion of the
ramparts which faces the flats of Gallega, accompanied
by some of the officers of my staff, when the
young lieutenant, Juan Escudero, approached to
inform me, in a voice broken with grief, of his
father's sudden death, and to request leave of
absence to attend his obsequies.
</p>

<p>
"My heart was struck with remorse, and grew
sick with shame.  I placed my purse in his hand; I
gave him my best horse, and bade him begone to
Orizaba with good speed; but I trembled like a
craven in my soul for the hour of his return.
</p>

<p>
"A few days passed, and the young lieutenant
came back.
</p>

<p>
"I was walking alone on the same ramparts when
I saw him steadily approaching me.  He was clad
in his uniform, and his silver epaulettes glittered in
the sun.  He had a band of crape on his right arm,
and another on the hilt of his sword&mdash;a soldier's
simple mourning for a lost parent, and, alas! a lost
honour.
</p>

<p>
"He came straight up to me; his handsome face,
so like the face of Mariquita, was deadly pale; but
the glare of wild hate shone in his eyes, and his
nether lip quivered spasmodically.
</p>

<p>
"'Senor Don Pedro de Barradas,' said he,
saluting me, ceremoniously, 'I have the honour to
confess the many services you have rendered my
family in the days when you were true to yourself
and to us.  For all these I beg to thank you.  But
I have also to confess the many deep wrongs you
have done us, and I here brand you, before God
and man, as a villain and a coward, whom I have
vowed to kill like a dog, here on the ramparts of
San Juan de Ulloa!'
</p>

<p>
"My heart sank, and my hand trembled.
</p>

<p>
"'Senor Teniente&mdash;Senor Escudero,' I began, in
a rash and vague attempt to explain or to extenuate;
but the brother of Mariquita was mad with
ungovernable fury, and he rushed upon me, sword in
hand.
</p>

<p>
"I knew that he would kill me without mercy,
and that there was nothing left for me but to defend
my life to the utmost, and to do this all my skill
was requisite.
</p>

<p>
"I was the best swordsman in La Vera Cruz; but
he was twenty years my junior, young, active, and
filled with just rage and indignation.
</p>

<p>
"Compelled to stand on my own defence, my
sole object was to ward off his cuts, to parry his
thrusts, and to keep him at bay till the castle guard
came to separate us.  I sought to disarm, and if
driven to sore extremity to wound him only; but
while he was making a desperate lunge at me, my
sword entered his heart.  I felt its hot blood spout
upon the blade, and pour through the hilt
upon my hand, as I flung my weapon down in grief
and dismay.
</p>

<p>
"Juan threw up his hands, and uttered a wild
cry.  It was 'Mariquita,' as he fell dead on his face,
at my feet.
</p>

<p>
"Long, long did a horror of these events oppress
me.  I buried him in the church of the Augustine
Friars, and had one hundred masses sung for the
repose of his soul&mdash;oh, who will say one for me!&mdash;I
would have made some effort to requite the living
victim of my wickedness; but now retribution came
upon me.
</p>

<p>
"Mariquita was still living at her father's old
<i>granja</i>, on the borders of the Barranca Secca, in
shame and seclusion, nursing her children, Pedro
and Zuares, who now bore the dishonoured name of
Barradas, and each of whom had, strange to say, a
little red cross, like that of Santiago, on his left
shoulder, where their mother's hand engraved it,
lest the children should be lost.
</p>

<p>
"About a month after Juan's death, I was
betrayed by some of his friends into the hands of
the troops of his Majesty Ferdinand VII., and was
placed by them on board a vessel for conveyance to
Spain, where an ignominious death as a traitor
awaited me.
</p>

<p>
"When passing near this isle, a heavy gale came
on, and I fell overboard.  In such a sea, to save me
was impossible; but a sailor heard my shriek of
despair, and cast over to me a hencoop.
</p>

<p>
"God, in his goodness, enabled me to reach it, and
after drifting on the dark ocean for more than an
hour, I was cast ashore, and here have I remained
ever since, leading a life of piety and austerity, of
penance and of prayer, in the humble and earnest
hope that this imitation of the holy men of old may
atone for the errors I committed in the world as
Don Pedro Zuares Miguel de Barradas.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Rueguen a Dios por el."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Such was the substance of this strange confession,
which we have written out in a more readable and
coherent form than Morrison found it, and which
throws a light on the parentage and origin of the
two dark seamen on board the <i>Hermione</i>; and as for
the fate of the hapless Mariquita, the reader has
already learned it from Captain Hawkshaw's
unpleasant reminiscence of the Barranca Secca.
</p>

<p>
The evening of the next day saw the <i>Princess</i>
steering for the north-western extremity of the
island of Tristan d'Acunha.  At nine o' clock,
Bartelot ordered a light to be hoisted at the end of
the foretopmast studdingsail boom, and a gun to be
fired, as a signal for a shore boat, which promptly
came off from this remarkable place.
</p>

<p>
As he wanted fresh water, the captain continued
to stand off and on till dawn next day, when Morley,
who had spent the morning watch in successful
fishing, had the gratification of seeing the sun rise
on the isle of Don Tristan d'Acunha.
</p>

<p>
Situated far amid the lonely waves of the Southern
Atlantic, at the distance of 1,500 miles from any
continent, this lofty island has a peak of 5,000 feet
in height above the level of its beach.  At dawn it
seemed like a cone of flame, shaded off by purple
tints, and towering amid a rose-coloured sea, whose
depth is so vast that it far exceeds even the height
of Tristan's loftiest peak.
</p>

<p>
Two islands are near it: one is named the Inaccessible;
the other, the island of the Nightingale;
but they are mere masses of wild storm-beaten
rock, against which the ocean rolls its masses of
foam, and above which, in the amber-tinted sky, a
cloud of sea-hens, petrels, and albatrosses wheel
and flutter.
</p>

<p>
In the little town which held a British garrison
when our imperial captive pined in St. Helena, there
is a mixed population of English and Portuguese
mulattoes, though the isle is described in a recent
gazetteer as being as desolate as when the Cavalier
Tristan d'Acunha traversed the southern sea with
his high-pooped caravel, and gave the place his
name, in the first years of the sixteenth century.
</p>

<p>
Morley, Gawthrop, and three of the crew went
ashore in the jolly-boat to procure some fresh water
and vegetables.  Morrison followed in the quarter-boat;
both returned in about an hour, and after
what they had brought off was put on board, they
were sent ahead with a warp to tow the ship off the
land, towards which a dangerous current had been
drifting her.
</p>

<p>
A fine breeze soon after sprang up; the <i>Princess</i>
bore away upon her course, and ere midnight came
down upon the sea, she had bade a last farewell to
the lofty isle of Tristan d'Acunha.
</p>

<p>
When next we see her on the ocean, we shall have
something to narrate very different from the hitherto
peaceful and prosperous voyages of Bartelot and his
shipmates.

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br /><br />
THE CREW OF THE "HERMIONE" DISCONTENTED.
</h3>

<p>
For days Captain Hawkshaw was haunted by the
recollection of that strange episode, the sinking
corpse; whose features&mdash;seen through the fevered
medium of his own imagination and his guilty
conscience&mdash;seemed to assume the likeness of Morley
Ashton, as they went slowly down through the green,
translucent sea, after Dr. Leslie Heriot had attached
the cannon-shot to its heels.
</p>

<p>
He accounted for the exclamation of horror that
escaped him, by saying to those in the boat that he
felt a sudden qualm of sickness, of disgust, or a
giddiness; and his first resource when on board
was to Joe, the captain's steward, for his brandy
bottle.
</p>

<p>
When he began to reason with himself, however,
in a calmer moment, he perceived the impossibility
of the remains being those of Morley Ashton, as no
influence of current, tide, or wind could have drifted
them from the coast of Britain so far through the
ocean as the South Atlantic.
</p>

<p>
The idea was absurd&mdash;impossible!
</p>

<p>
Moreover, the drowned man had not been dead
more than a week to all appearance; and then his
hands had grasped a life-buoy, evincing that he
must have fallen overboard from some ship, or been
the victim of a wreck.
</p>

<p>
When the impression of that affair began to wear
away, his fears of the two Barradas, and a
recollection of the manner in which Pedro, Bill Badger,
the bulky Yankee, and others of the crew had
insulted him, resumed their sway; but after a time
he began to take courage.
</p>

<p>
"What have I to fear from the Barradas?
Nothing!" he would whisper to himself, as if to
gather comfort from the echo of his own thoughts.
"Suppose they denounce me to my friends&mdash;to
Ethel&mdash;I have simply to deny, and that is all.  The
story of the padre&mdash;d&mdash;&mdash;nation!&mdash;no, I mean of
the Barranca Secca&mdash;I have already told, and
Master Zuares does not shine in that affair.  Even
to Ethel it is nothing new, for I have related it
more than once, to increase her horror of the
Barradas when the crisis comes."
</p>

<p>
A <i>crisis</i> was coming, which the captain did not
quite foresee!
</p>

<p>
"Even to Ethel it is nothing new&mdash;I can deny,
deny, and defy them all.  'Tis only my word against
theirs."
</p>

<p>
This was all very well; but ere the voyage ended
there occurred several events, which alike put the
captain's courage and resolution to flight.
</p>

<p>
As the <i>Hermione</i> approached the Cape of Good
Hope, she encountered alternate storms and calms,
with weather so unusually cold for the season, that
Hawkshaw had a fair excuse for permitting his
whiskers and moustache to resume their wonted
aspect of luxuriance, as he had ceased to hope for
concealment on board.
</p>

<p>
Though pretty well inured now, by their very
protracted voyage, to the discomforts of ship-life,
Ethel and Rose Basset remained a good deal in the
cabin, especially the former, to avoid Hawkshaw's
attention, which were thus repressed by the presence
of the captain, when it was not his watch, of
Mr. Quail, or her father, who preferred to lie reading or
lounging on the cabin locker, to facing on deck the
spoon-drift that flew over the lee quarter when the
ship was going free.
</p>

<p>
She found Adrian Manfredi, the young Italian
mate, a pleasant companion, for Rose rather
absorbed the society of Dr. Heriot.  He was
gentlemanly and well bred; he had seen much of
the world, and her preference for him was so
decided, that Hawkshaw felt at times a pang of
jealous rage in his heart, which was in no way
soothed when, in the mate's hours of leisure, they
took to reading together in Italian, "I Promessi
Sposi," the beautiful novel of Alessandro Manzoni,
from the neat little three-volume edition, printed at
Lugano.
</p>

<p>
This emotion became all the more bitter after
Ethel gave Manfredi a handsome gold locket, to hold
the hair of his little brother, "the brave boy, Attilio,"
whose story he told in a previous chapter.
</p>

<p>
The young man was no doubt charmed by the
beauty and society of a sweet English girl like Ethel
Basset; thus his voice became mellow and soft
whenever he addressed her, and his eyes sparkled with
admiration and pleasure whenever he saw her, but
beyond this, no sign of a deeper emotion escaped
him.  Perhaps he felt the folly or futility of
encouraging it.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, Ethel's preference for him was
greatly induced by some real or imaginary
resemblance which she saw, or thought she saw, in his
features to those of Morley Ashton; though Rose
and her father failed to perceive it, and Hawkshaw,
who always trembled in his soul at the young man's
name, treated the idea with angry ridicule.
</p>

<p>
The sullenness and other growing peculiarities in
the bearing of the crew had been increasing, so that
some would scarcely obey those orders necessary for
the working of the ship.  Captain Phillips, though
full of anxiety for the probable issue, resolved to
forbear until a ship of war hove in sight, or until he
could dismiss some and put others in prison, if this
state of matters still continued, when the <i>Hermione</i>
hauled up for Table Bay.
</p>

<p>
One day Adrian Manfredi had charge of the deck.
</p>

<p>
The ship was running nearly fair before a fine
topgallant breeze; there was not much of a sea on, but
the sky was lowering, and a great gray bank of cloud
was resting on the ocean to the northward, for they
were encountering regular Cape weather now.
</p>

<p>
Manfredi was conversing with Ethel from time to
time, and she was still busy with the last volume of
"I Promessi Sposi," when one of the crew, named
Samuel Sharkey, a coarse, square stump of a fellow,
having great misshapen hands, a large and very ugly
visage, came deliberately aft, with a short black pipe
in his mouth, and stood near her, puffing with great
coolness, and eyeing her with a very admiring leer.
</p>

<p>
Ethel glanced at him uneasily, and removed to a
seat nearer the taffrail, for there was cool insolence
in the man's sinister eyes and bearing which alarmed
her very much.
</p>

<p>
On this, Sharkey, the seaman, gave a peculiar
whistle, to which Bill Badger, the tall, ungainly
Yankee, who was at the wheel, responded; and these
signals now attracted the attention of Manfredi, who
had been looking aloft, and securing some of the
halyards to the belaying-pins.
</p>

<p>
"Hollo, you sir!" said he, "what do you want
aft, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"None o' your grand airs, Mister Manfreddy,"
was the sulky response, "'cos they won't do in this
part o' blue water, so I tells you at once."
</p>

<p>
"Take that pipe out of your mouth; remember
that you are on the quarter-deck, and there is a lady
here."
</p>

<p>
"That is just what brought me aft.  Are you
chaps and the cabin passengers a goin' to keep the
gals&mdash;the old judge's darters&mdash;all to yourselves?  I
don't mean to offend you, marm; oh, not at all, by
no manner o' means," he continued, making a mock
bow to Ethel; "but, shiver my topsails, if, mayhap,
we won't be better acquainted afore we sights Maddygascar
and the gut of the Mosambique Channel&mdash;ha, ha!"
</p>

<p>
And as he concluded he continued to leer at Ethel.
</p>

<p>
"You are drunk, fellow," said Manfredi, who was
resolved to keep his temper, if possible, for the man's
words contained in them a reference to ultimate views
sufficiently daring to excite alarm.
</p>

<p>
"I am no more a feller than you are, mayhap not
so much," replied Sharkey, taking his huge square
hands out of his trousers pockets and proceeding to
clench them very ominously; "and as for being two
or three cloths in the wind, 'taint the six-water grog
as we gets aboard o' this 'ere beastly craft as will
make me so."
</p>

<p>
"Go forward, I command you, or by Heaven I'll
throw you overboard," said Manfredi, in a hoarse
voice.
</p>

<p>
"If you want to swim, there may be two as can
play at that," responded the ugly seaman; "but I
knows summut easier in seamanship, and I would
advise you to l'arn it."
</p>

<p>
"What is it?"
</p>

<p>
"To run ten knots an hour right in the wind's eye,
with everything set that will draw, aloft and alow,
skyscrapers, moonrakers, and all."
</p>

<p>
"My dear Miss Basset, I beg of you to excuse
this scene, and permit me to lead you below," said
Manfredi, with an agitated manner, to Ethel, who
had listened to all this with great dismay.
</p>

<p>
"My dear, don't do nothin' o' the sort; just stay
here and see how I'll rib-roast him," said Sharkey.
</p>

<p>
"Go forward, you gallows lubber!" thundered
Manfredi, growing pale with a passion which he
strove to repress, lest he should terrify Ethel, between
whom and this seaman he interposed.
</p>

<p>
Sharkey, instead of complying, put his right hand
behind him, and suddenly drew forth a sheath-knife&mdash;one
of those ugly weapons which few seamen are
now without.  Armed with this, he was about to
make a rush at Manfredi, when the latter, quick as
thought, and as if he had anticipated some such
catastrophe, snatched up a heavy iron marlinespike
and hurled it full at Sharkey's head, with such force
and unerring aim that he was knocked down, senseless
and bleeding, with a severe wound on the head.
</p>

<p>
"Carry the scoundrel forward, and drench him
well with salt water, to bring him to," said Manfredi,
while panting with excitement, to the Barradas and
some of the crew who had run aft.  He took the
knife from Sharkey's relaxed hand, and threw it
into the sea, adding, "I will serve every man who
disobeys me now in the same fashion, and tow him
overboard for twenty knots at the end of a line, if
the captain will allow me."
</p>

<p>
"Mayhap as you won't," growled Sharkey,
recovering a little, as he was lifted up by his sulky and
muttering messmates; "and if you don't repent
this work <i>afore to-morrow morning</i>, you infernal
Hytalian, my name ain't Sam Sharkey!"
</p>

<p>
That some general outbreak among the crew was
on the <i>tapis</i>, and might have taken place but for his
own resolute conduct, Manfredi had not a doubt.
</p>

<p>
With his face covered with blood, the mutineer
was carried forward, and Dr. Heriot (whom Ethel's
scream when she beheld the scuffle had brought on
deck) with others, hastened to the forecastle to
examine the wound and have it dressed.
</p>

<p>
The marlinespike, an iron instrument that tapers
like a pin, and is used for separating the strands of
rope when splicing or marling, had inflicted a severe
wound on the forehead of Sharkey, and the blood
was flowing freely from it.
</p>

<p>
He growled and swore, using fearful oaths and
threats, while Heriot, bathed, dressed, and bandaged
the gash.  Captain Phillips threatened to have him
put in irons till the ship reached Cape Town; but
as the wound was severe, he permitted him to
remain in his berth in the forecastle bunks, where
his shipmates remained to console him, and hear his
reiterated threats of revenge.
</p>

<p>
Manfredi apologised to Ethel for the alarm he had
unwittingly caused her, but added that no other
course was left him but to strike the ruffian down,
to preserve his own life and authority.
</p>

<p>
Quiet Mr. Quail made a due entry of the event
among his columns of "remarks" in the ship's log,
while Mr. Basset waxed warm at the affair, and
expounded learnedly and as became a new-fledged
judge, on the law relating to merchant seamen,
quoting Shee's edition of "Lord Tenterden," and so
forth with great fluency.
</p>

<p>
So generous and forgiving was Manfredi, that, at
lunch time, he sent boy Joe, the captain's steward,
forward with a tot of brandy to the patient in the
forecastle, and the amiable Mr. Sharkey drank it to
the last drop, with a fearful invocation of curses on
the donor's head, and thereupon dashed the wooden
tot in Joe's face.
</p>

<p>
Before the first dog-watch the event was apparently
forgotten; but it increased the desire of
Captain Phillips to reach Cape Town and get rid of
some of his crew.

CHAPTER III.
<br /><br />
ROSE AND DR. HERIOT.
</h3>

<p>
Supper was over in the cabin, and the little
community there would soon be separating for the night,
or "turning in," as it is technically named.
</p>

<p>
"How brightly the stars are shining," said Rose,
as she peeped up through the skylight.
</p>

<p>
"Should you like to go on deck for a moment?"
asked Dr. Heriot, in a low voice, as he hastened to
her side.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;for a moment only."
</p>

<p>
"Take care of chill," said Mr. Basset, warningly.
</p>

<p>
"Take care rather of yourself, Miss Rose, and, of
all things, take care of the doctor," said Captain
Phillips, laughing.  "Manfredi has charge of the
deck; see how she is trimmed aloft.  Report to me
when you come down, and then I'll turn in."
</p>

<p>
Rose coloured on hearing the captain's bantering
tone, as she threw a shawl over her head and
shoulders, took the doctor's ready arm, and hastened
up the companion-stair.
</p>

<p>
Ethel smiled sadly at her joyous and girlish sister,
for she had seen how the intimacy between the
young doctor and Rose had been ripening; and she
wondered, or speculated on, how they would separate
when the tedious voyage was over.  Then she
thought of Morley Ashton, and the fatal blight that
had fallen so awfully and mysteriously upon her own
first love.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Basset," said Hawkshaw, rising, "would
you wish&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"To go on deck?  Oh, no, thank you," said she
hurriedly, anticipating and replying to his offer
without looking up from "I Promessi Sposi."
</p>

<p>
Hawkshaw seated himself again, and bit his lip,
while that malignant gleam which filled his eyes
at times shot from them covertly and unseen.
</p>

<p>
He made one other effort to engage her in
conversation, by saying, in a low voice, as he stooped
over her:
</p>

<p>
"Your sad smiles, Ethel, go straight to my heart,
with an effect, believe me, that is cruel&mdash;killing!"
</p>

<p>
"Why!  it seems that 'I can smile, and murder
while I smile,' as Shakespeare says.  Is it so?"
</p>

<p>
"Bantering&mdash;bantering still&mdash;even here, when
on the verge of destruction, perhaps!" muttered
Hawkshaw, as he drew back with another fierce but
covert gleam in his stealthy eyes, and Ethel never
lifted hers again from her book, until a noise on
deck aroused her.
</p>

<p>
Rose clung closely and affectionately to the
doctor's arm, as they traversed the quarter-deck
towards the taffrail, and turned to look at the
ship, at the sky overhead, through which the wild
black scud was driving, and on the mysterious world
of water and of darkness, through which she was
careering under a press of canvas.
</p>

<p>
Encouraged by Rose's ready accession to his
request, the young man held her right hand in
his, and pressed it tenderly to his heart.
</p>

<p>
There was none near them save the man at the
wheel; for it was about the middle of the first
watch, or nearer eleven o'clock.
</p>

<p>
Rose had a presentiment that a crisis was
approaching in her relations with the young doctor.
The somewhat annoying banter of Captain Phillips,
the affectionate warnings of Ethel, and the praises of
him so loudly sung by her old nurse, had all, in a
manner, prepared her for it, as much as the steady
and delicate attention he paid herself.
</p>

<p>
Nightly, when Rose retired to rest in that little
cabin, which seemed so small, so very small, the
first night they occupied it, Nance Folgate was
wont to chant her praises of the handsome doctor.
</p>

<p>
"Lor' a mussy me!&mdash;for a Scotchman&mdash;he is such
a sweet dispositioned youth, Miss Rose.  Oh, yes! now,
ain't he, miss?  He gives me no end o' cordials
and stuffs when I'm in low spirits, which are often
the case, 'specially when it blows 'ard, and the ship
tumbles about.  There is such a modesty in all his
words and ways&mdash;now, ain't there?  If I was a fine
young gal like you, instead o' bein' a poor old
toothless thing, I would love him, that I would, when I
saw how much he loved me&mdash;he is such a nice
young man, is the doctor.  But why don't you
answer, miss?"
</p>

<p>
If Rose did not reply to such rhapsodies as these,
it was not because she disagreed with them; but
her young heart was wild with pleasure, and she
often affected to be asleep that she might conceal
her flushing cheek on her pillow.  But if the young
doctor had won over the old nurse, it was just as he
had won over the quiet and unaffected Mr. Quail, or
anyone else, as he was a good obliging fellow, and
fond of doing kind offices for all.  So Rose, yielding
to an irresistible impulse, assented to a tête-à-tête
on deck, on the night in question.
</p>

<p>
After a silence of some minutes&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"How strange it is," said Rose, in her soft, sweet
voice, "that amid the wind which moans through
the rigging, I seem to hear the sound of bells."
</p>

<p>
"Bells?"
</p>

<p>
"Or is it from the bottom of the sea?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't say so, Rose," replied Heriot.
</p>

<p>
This sounded strange in both their ears, as he had.
never simply called her "Rose" before; yet the
implied familiarity was not without its novelty and
charm.
</p>

<p>
"Why may I not say so?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"It is an old superstition of our Scottish sailors
that the bells of wrecks and sunken ships are rung
by mysterious hands at the bottom of the sea, to
announce storms and disasters."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, but you Scots are so superstitious; you live
in a land of omens and ghosts, predictions and
dreams, even in these fast railway times."
</p>

<p>
"Yet I would that we were in Scotland now,"
said Heriot, with a sigh, as he thought of the doubts
and clouds that veiled the future.
</p>

<p>
"We?" repeated Rose, inquiringly, while peeping
from her hood and shawl, so that the light of the
binnacle lamp fell full on her sweet young face, and
very beautiful the dark-eyed girl looked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, we," reiterated Heriot, whose heart was
rushing to his head as he held, unresisted, her plump
little hands in his.  "I wish to speak with you, Rose,
to&mdash;to&mdash;I have so long desired&mdash;do you&mdash;do you
care for me Rose, dear Rose?"
</p>

<p>
"Care for you!" she repeated, faintly.
</p>

<p>
"Can you love me, dear, dear Rose, as I love you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Rose, in a whisper, as her head
dropped on Heriot's shoulder, and his lips were
pressed on her throbbing brow, for now the great
secret was told, and all her pulses beat with a new,
happiness.
</p>

<p>
A few moments of joyous silence followed.  Then
crossing the deck to leeward, they were more in
obscurity; and fortunately for them, Manfredi at
that moment went forward, so Heriot pressed Rose
to his breast, and said in a low, earnest, and agitated
voice:
</p>

<p>
"But Rose&mdash;my beloved Rose; to what end do I
love you?&mdash;to what purpose?&mdash;how taught you
love to me?  We are to land you at the Isle of
France, and then sail on through the Indian Seas&mdash;to
leave you&mdash;leave you there, for I have no home&mdash;no
settled abode."
</p>

<p>
("Papa's daughters are unlucky in their lovers,"
thought Rose.)  She replied, however, while tears
of apprehension filled her eyes:
</p>

<p>
"Why cannot you leave the ship?  Sailing with
it to and fro must be very tiresome."
</p>

<p>
"Leave it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and live with us in the Isle of France."
</p>

<p>
"Live with you, Rose?" said Heriot, with sad
perplexity.
</p>

<p>
"Settle, I mean&mdash;at least, while papa is there."
</p>

<p>
"I cannot, even if I had the means.  I am bound
to the owners and to Captain Phillips, for this
voyage at least, unless the <i>Hermione</i> procures
another medical officer."
</p>

<p>
"At Singapore?"
</p>

<p>
Heriot smiled sadly at Rose's simplicity.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, yes&mdash;that will be delightful! and if poor
dear Morley Ashton, who is dead, were here with us
now, how happy Ethel and we should all have
been!" exclaimed Rose, while nursing herself
into a mood of the most prosperous cheerfulness,
as her happy young spirit soared into a bright
world all her own, and Heriot caressingly slipped
a ring on her "engagement" finger, whispering in
her ear:
</p>

<p>
"It was my mother's, Rose&mdash;wear it, at all events,
for her sake and mine."
</p>

<p>
Another kiss and the bond was sealed.  Then
Rose, in a tumult of joy that could only find vent in
tears, hurried below, with her head inclined on
Ethel's bosom, told her of all that had passed
between Leslie Heriot and herself&mdash;a pretty little
narrative, interspersed with hesitations, smiles, and
blushes, till they were startled by the wild hubbub
that reigned on deck, where a terrible catastrophe
had occurred.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap04"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br /><br />
MAN OVERBOARD.
</h3>

<p>
A sudden squall, and a sea which heavily swept over
the poop with a shower of blinding spray, that hissed
away amidships, had first driven Rose and Heriot
below, and just as they retired hand in hand, they
heard the voice of Manfredi, shouting through the
wild blast:
</p>

<p>
"Below there! all hands ahoy! come, tumble up
to take in sail!"
</p>

<p>
Then the men were heard grumbling and swearing
as they hurried half-dressed out of the forecastle
bunks, to assist the watch; next followed the orders
"to let go," "haul down," "clew up," amid the
cracking and flapping of the canvas, as the topsails
were lowered almost to the caps; the royals and
topgallant sails taken off her; flying gib and studding
sails all in in a twinkling, though for a time the
wind howled fearfully, and the ship careered before
its fierce breath almost on her beam-ends.  Little
more than steering canvas was left upon her, for
wild and black was the Atlantic squall that had
come suddenly over her, accompanied by torrents
of rain, that rattled on deck, like a tempest
of rouncival peas, while ever and anon the red
lightning flashed vividly at the horizon, but still the
brave ship flew on.
</p>

<p>
"By the sky to-day I knew we should have a gale
to-night," said Captain Phillips cheerfully, as he
donned his storm-jacket of shiny oilskin, and came
on deck.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'A mackerel sky and grey mares' tails<br />
  Make lofty ships carry lowly sails.'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
A glorious sailor is Manfredi!  How smartly he
had all the cloth off her.  But we'll need our best
umbrellas to-night."
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, from the forecastle, through the many
wild sounds of the squall, there came the appalling
cry:
</p>

<p>
"A man overboard! hard down! hard down!"
</p>

<p>
Other shouts followed.
</p>

<p>
"Ahoy! heave over the life buoy! mainsail to
the wind! clear away a boat!"
</p>

<p>
Captain Phillips grasped his trumpet; Mr. Quail&mdash;who
had just turned into his berth with his
clothes on, "all standing"&mdash;Dr. Heriot, and
Hawkshaw sprang on deck at this new alarm.
</p>

<p>
"Hard down with the helm!" cried Phillips;
"to the braces, men! let go, and haul!  Back with
the mainyard!  Ready the starboard quarter boat,
and cut away the life-buoy!"
</p>

<p>
The mainsail was speedily laid to the mast, though
there was great danger lest, in such a gale, it might
be carried away entirely, and, in the excitement of
the moment, even the most sullen of that ill-assorted
crew worked cheerily and well.
</p>

<p>
Alternately the huge ship rose and sank on the
mighty rolling waves; and now the spray flew from
stem to stern over her in white and blinding sheets,
plashing over her courses, and hissing under the
arched leaches of the bellying sails.
</p>

<p>
Upheaved she rose on the foaming surge one moment,
to sink down into the yawning trough of the
sea the next, loose spars, buckets, handspikes, and
everything else adrift, going to leeward, and overboard.
</p>

<p>
A faint but despairing cry came from the waves;
another followed, as the drowning man, struggling
hard for existence, rose on the white, foamy crest
of a wave, and then sank for ever into the black
and gaping bosom of the midnight sea.
</p>

<p>
Then, after some minutes of the most painful and
lingering suspense, the captain, the doctor, and
others, came to the conclusion that all was over, and
that the poor victim must have perished, for it was
found impossible to lower a boat with safety, or
with the least hope of success, in such a sea or squall.
</p>

<p>
"Fill the mainyard, Mr. Foster," said the captain
to the second mate.  And he sighed bitterly as he
spoke, for John Phillips was a kind and good-hearted
man.  "God receive the poor fellow!  We
could do nothing more.  Let the ship lie her course;
muster the hands aft, please, and see who is missing."
</p>

<p>
The yard heads were filled; the vessel's bow fell
off from the wind, and there was less strain upon
her now, and less spray broke over her, as she tore
through the sea at liberty.
</p>

<p>
Aft the mizzenmast the drenched seamen mustered.
</p>

<p>
"Boy Joe! steward! bring a lantern," said the
captain.
</p>

<p>
And now, by its weird light, were to be seen the
two dark and sullen Barradas; Bill Badger, the
bulky and insolent Yankee; the square, squat, and
ugly Sharkey, with his head bandaged up; the
Messieurs Brewser, Batter, Cribbit, and others of
that remarkable crew.
</p>

<p>
"Are all present, Mr. Quail?" asked the captain,
as the mate passed the lantern along the dripping
line.
</p>

<p>
"All except <i>one</i>, sir," replied Mr. Quail, whose
face wore a very ashy hue and alarmed expression.
</p>

<p>
"Who is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Manfredi, sir; he is nowhere on deck."
</p>

<p>
"'Twas his watch, was it not?" said Phillips,
starting.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Good Heavens, can it be?" exclaimed the
captain, in an agitated voice, as the threat of
Sharkey occurred to him.  "If there has been foul
play to-night, I say woe to the perpetrator of it!"
</p>

<p>
Some one now uttered a snorting laugh in the
dark.
</p>

<p>
"Let us search below," said the doctor, taking
the steward's lantern, and proceeding to examine in
person.
</p>

<p>
He did so, and soon returned to report that no
trace of Adrian Manfredi could be found, so the
crew were dismissed.
</p>

<p>
"Who was the person that called out 'Man
overboard?'&mdash;who saw him last?" demanded the
captain, as they descended to the cabin.
</p>

<p>
"I did, sir," said Joe the steward, as he closed
the door.  "I was stowing the jib in its netting
with Pedro Barradas," he continued, in a low voice,
as if afraid to be overheard.  "Mr. Manfredi was
standing on the topgallant forecastle, holding on
by a rope and directing us.  Our heads were stooped
over our work, when all of a sudden we heard a cry.
On looking one way, I saw him falling into the sea;
on looking another, I saw a man in his shirt-sleeves,
armed with a capstan bar, slipping down into the
forecastle bunks."
</p>

<p>
"A man?" repeated the listeners.
</p>

<p>
"Did he strike him overboard?" asked the
captain.
</p>

<p>
"We supposed so," replied Joe, in a whisper, and
glancing furtively at the skylight.
</p>

<p>
"We."
</p>

<p>
"That is, Pedro Barradas and I.  He laughed&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The mutinous villain!"
</p>

<p>
"And tried to stop me from shouting to put the
helm down."
</p>

<p>
"Did you see the man's face?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Who do you think he was&mdash;speak!" said
Captain Phillips, perceiving that Joe, a fat,
good-natured fellow, with flabby cheeks, and large
boiled-looking gray eyes, hesitated through fear,
"speak!"
</p>

<p>
"I am frightened, in this ship, almost to say who
I thought he was."
</p>

<p>
"In this ship&mdash;right!  Was it Sharkey, eh?"
</p>

<p>
The steward's teeth chattered.  He again glanced
fearfully at the skylight, and gave a nod in the
affirmative, and the captain struck his right heel on
the floor.
</p>

<p>
"There has been murder committed on board
to-night; yes, a most foul murder!" he continued,
turning by a mere coincidence to Hawkshaw, who,
on hearing the terrible word, grew deadly pale, and
trembled violently from head to foot.  "Would to
Heaven that I had only half-a-dozen good hard-a-weather
English seamen to keep this coloured lot in
order.  Even Lascars of the lowest caste were better
than what we have!"
</p>

<p>
The consternation in the cabin was very great,
and the conversation continued below, and the storm
above, till Mr. Quail, with many unpleasant
forebodings, went on deck to relieve the watch at four
o'clock A.M., when the wind began to abate and
the sea to go down.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap05"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br /><br />
THE LIVID FACE.
</h3>

<p>
The event of the night shed a gloom, a horror, over
all in the cabin next day; nor was the alarm in the
breasts of Captain Phillips and his mates in the
least soothed, when it was remarked that the cook's
grindstone was kept at work all the forenoon, and
a most ominous sharpening of sheath and clasp-knives
went on, while sundry jokes were uttered
audibly about "Mister Manfreddy having gone on
a visit to Mr. David Jones and Old Mother Carey,
without his umbrella, too;" "and the rain a fallin'
like Niagary," as Badger, the Yankee, added, with
a diabolical grin.
</p>

<p>
The morning sky was gray and cloudy; a heavy
sea was still on, and not a sail was in sight, so
Captain Phillips swept the horizon with his telescope
in vain.
</p>

<p>
At breakfast Ethel and her sister were informed
that Mr. Manfredi had fallen overboard in the night,
and been drowned.  No hint of foul play was given
them, at their father's special request; but they
wept and mourned for the poor young fellow, of
whom they now recalled to memory so many pleasing
traits and anecdotes; among others, the sad
story of his little brother, Attilio, who had been so
savagely shot by the Austrians at Pistoja.
</p>

<p>
His seat at table, his place in the cabin were
empty; his face and form were no longer seen, and
his step and voice were no longer heard.
</p>

<p>
The suddenness of the catastrophe seemed most
difficult of realisation; and the words of Dana, in a
passage of one of his works, which Dr. Heriot
pointed out to Rose, came painfully and truthfully
home to all their hearts.
</p>

<p>
"Death is at all times solemn, but never so much
so as at sea.  A man dies on shore; his body
remains with his friends, and the mourners go about
the streets; but, when a man falls overboard at sea
and is lost, there is a suddenness in the event which
gives it an air of awful mystery.  Then at sea you
miss a man so much.  A dozen men are shut up
together in a little bark upon the wide wide sea, and
for months and months see no forms and hear no
voices but their own; but one is suddenly taken
from among them, and they miss him at every turn.
There are no new forms or faces to fill up the gap.
There is always an empty berth in the forecastle,
and one more wanting when the small night-watch
is mustered.  There is one less to take the wheel,
one less to lay out with you upon the yard.  You
miss his form and the sound of his voice&mdash;for habit
had made them almost necessary to you, and each
of your senses feels the loss."
</p>

<p>
"So we shall never see him again&mdash;never!" said
Ethel, with her eyes full of tears; "so kind, good,
and gentle."
</p>

<p>
"And so handsome, too!" added Rose.
</p>

<p>
"A better seaman never trod a deck," sighed Mr. Quail.
</p>

<p>
"Damnation!" was the singular addendum of
Captain Phillips, through his clenched teeth, when
thinking of the secret he had not revealed, and the
crime which, as yet, he dared not attempt to punish.
</p>

<p>
So Ethel put past "I Promessi Sposi," which had
Manfredi's name written on the fly-leaf of the first
volume, as the relic of a friend with whom she had
spent many happy hours, whom she never more
could see, and on whose vast tomb, the boundless
ocean, she almost shuddered to look&mdash;for was not
Morley Ashton sleeping there too?
</p>

<p>
So the gloomy day passed slowly on, and night
came on.
</p>

<p>
Retired to their little cabin, Ethel and Rose were
disrobing for rest&mdash;Nance Folgate had long since
gone to sleep&mdash;and now, relinquishing the sad
subject of Manfredi, Rose, with a blush on her charming
face, was detailing to Ethel, for the second time,
her interview with Leslie Heriot, whose ring&mdash;containing
a large Scottish pearl, set with diamonds&mdash;glittered
on the engaged finger of her left hand.
</p>

<p>
"And you are sure that you love him, Rose?" said
Ethel, as she took her sister's face caressingly and
affectionately between her soft hands.
</p>

<p>
"Dearly, devotedly," was the energetic reply.
"How could I do otherwise, when he is such a kind,
darling fellow&mdash;and so handsome too?"
</p>

<p>
"Have you weighed well the probabilities of the
future?"
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean, Ethel dear?"
</p>

<p>
"What papa may think."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Leslie will speak to papa to-morrow, or on
the next day, at the latest."
</p>

<p>
Ethel smiled sadly at her sister's confidence.
</p>

<p>
"Our voyage will soon be over, dear Rose," said
she, shaking her head seriously.  "Once round the
Cape of Good Hope, we shall be speedily at the Isle
of France, and then your dream of joy will have an
end&mdash;a rough awaking; not so sad or rough as
mine, but a gloomy reality, and a doubtful future,
nevertheless."
</p>

<p>
Poor Rose's usually merry eyes now filled with
large tears, and she permitted the braids of her
fine dark hair, which her slender fingers were
wreathing up for the night, to roll down in
unheeded masses over her bare bosom and back, which
shone white as the new-fallen snowdrift, in the light
of the cabin lamp that swung above her.
</p>

<p>
"And Jack Page&mdash;poor Jack Page!" said Ethel,
smiling, to arouse Rose's spirit; "is he quite
forgotten&mdash;eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh bother Jack Page!" replied Rose, crimsoning,
and with the faintest tinge of irritation in her
tone, as she proceeded vigorously to knot up the
masses of black hair.  "He was a pleasant enough
fellow to flirt with, or play croquet with at Laurel
Lodge (dear old Laurel Lodge! ah, heavens!  Ethel,
shall we ever see it again?) He was a good fellow
for fishing or sailing on the mere&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And to botanise with, and to gather wild flowers
on Cherrywood Hill," added Ethel, a little
maliciously.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but he gave himself such insufferable airs
after he became a rifle volunteer; and as for loving
him, I should almost as soon think of loving your
adorer, the gallant Captain Hawkshaw.  By-the-by,
how taciturn he has become of late."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps he finds his task a hopeless one," said
Ethel, with a haughty smile.
</p>

<p>
"He seems quite changed somehow," said Rose,
slipping into bed, "does he not, Ethel dear?  Why
don't you speak to me?" added Rose, with sudden
alarm, and springing from her berth, on perceiving
her sister standing pale and motionless, her lips
parted, her dark eyes dilated with terror, and their
gaze fixed on the little circular window of their
cabin, which was simply a pane of thick glass, about
nine inches in diameter, framed in an iron ring, and
secured by a powerful bolt.
</p>

<p>
Rose gazed in the same direction, and beheld, to
her intense dismay, the whole aperture filled by a
human face&mdash;a man's apparently&mdash;pale, livid, green,
and distorted, as viewed through the coarse crystal,
with large keen eyes, that glared in upon them.
</p>

<p>
Whoever the person was that dared thus to
violate their privacy, he occupied a position of
extreme peril, for the little window in question was
below the plank sheer of the ship, and considerably
abaft the mizzen chains, so that the eavesdropper
must have been swinging alongside, almost with
his heels in the foam that boiled under the ship's
counter.
</p>

<p>
Could the sea give up its dead?
</p>

<p>
Was it a spectre&mdash;Manfredi, or Morley Ashton?
</p>

<p>
Such were Rose's first ideas, as she clung in
terror to her rigid but more resolute sister, who
sprang forward and vainly attempted with her
delicate hands to wrench round the bolt, and open
the little window; but at that moment a fierce and
sardonic smile seemed to spread over that livid and
distorted visage, which instantly vanished, and then
nothing was seen through the aperture but the vast
sea that rolled in the starlight far away.
</p>

<p>
"Papa&mdash;Nurse Folgate!" screamed Rose; but
the old woman slept like one of the seven sleepers.
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" said Ethel, "'twas only some insolent
seaman; but we must prevent a recurrence of this,"
she added, as she rapidly hung a species of curtain
over the window.  "Good heavens, Rose! to think
how often this may have happened before, and we
in total ignorance of it; but the captain shall be
told in the morning."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Ethel!" exclaimed Rose, "how terrified I am."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"At first I thought it was his ghost."
</p>

<p>
"Whose?"
</p>

<p>
"Poor Mr. Manfredi's."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense, child!"
</p>

<p>
"A ghost on board of a ship, how dreadful that
would be!  Almost as bad as a fire, for there would
be no escaping from it."
</p>

<p>
Inspired by natural emotions of doubt, Ethel
opened the door and peeped out into the great
cabin.  All was still and quiet there, at least
nothing was heard but the jarring of the rudder in its
case, and of the brass swings of the lamp and tell-tale
compass, with the heavy creaking of the ship's
timbers, the backwash under the counter, and one
other sound, to which she had become pretty familiar
about this time&mdash;to wit, the profound snoring of
Mr. Quail, as he lay at full length on the cabin
locker, with his peacoat spread over him, and his
sou'-wester at hand, ready to relieve the deck when
the middle-watch was called.
</p>

<p>
She secured the door, perhaps more carefully than
usual.  She knelt down by Rose's side to say her
prayers, after which they retired together, but lay
long awake, conversing of that future, the events of
which, happily, they could so little foresee, until
they dropped asleep, Rose with her charming face
half pillowed on Ethel's snowy shoulder.
</p>

<p>
All remained still in the ship; but while the two
sisters slept with arms entwined, each "hushed like
the callow cygnet in its nest," anxious hearts were
watching over them elsewhere; and they formed
the subject of a somewhat unusual, but animated,
discussion among the seamen&mdash;a discussion of
which, as yet, they were happily ignorant.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br /><br />
WHAT THE DOCTOR OVERHEARD IN THE FORECASTLE BUNKS.
</h3>

<p>
The love he bore Rose, the love that she permitted
him to bear, and which she so fully reciprocated,
together with the regard and esteem he had for the
grave, gentle Ethel, and good, easy Mr. Basset,
increased the anxiety with which the young Scotch
surgeon beheld the growing discontent of the
crew.
</p>

<p>
On deck, he more than once had heard them
conferring in most unpleasant terms about the
disappearance of the third mate, and, in reply to some
remark of Sharkey's, Zuares Barradas said, with a
cunning twinkle in his eyes:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Bueno! paso a paso va lejos.</i>"
</p>

<p>
"Wot the devil does that mean, shipmate?  Avast
with your Spanish.  Carn't you speak the queen's
English?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, it means that 'step by step goes far'.
Manfredi is gone; a little spell and we shall have
it all our own way," replied the Spanish American,
as he hitched up his trousers and slunk forward.
</p>

<p>
"These rascals are decidedly up to something&mdash;or
whence all this skulking about, this whispering
in gangs, and knife-sharpening," said Heriot to the
captain.
</p>

<p>
"The grindstone has never been idle all day,"
observed Mr. Quail, who was looking, as the captain
remarked, "rather white about the gills, in consequence."
</p>

<p>
After a long conference in the cabin, Dr. Heriot
offered, there being no moon about the middle of
the first night-watch, to creep forward to the
forecastle bunk, where, in defiance of orders, the crew
now kept a light burning after sundown, and
endeavour to overhear their conversation.  The duty
of acting eavesdropper was not a pleasant, but, in
this instance, a most necessary one.
</p>

<p>
The first night Heriot attempted this, he failed to
get forward unseen; but on the second, as the
atmosphere, though very cloudy, was fine, and the ship
under easy sail was going large, that is, with the
wind abaft the beam, which careened her slightly
to port, Heriot, armed with a sharp bowie-knife,
concealed in his breast, so as to be ready for any
emergency (for if discovered by the watch he might
be sent overboard after poor Manfredi) crept
forward on the leeside, keeping his head close under
the bulwarks, and in the shadow.
</p>

<p>
The men of the watch were all grouped to windward,
smoking with their backs against the long-boat,
and the steersman could see little else than
the lights that glared in the binnacles, and the ship's
canvas, that towered aloft between him and the
sky.
</p>

<p>
Through the two yolks of dense, thick glass that
admitted light to the forecastle bunks, in which the
seamen had their chests and berths, he could see
nothing, save that they had, as usual with them, in
defiance of the captain's order, a lamp or lantern,
the light of which glared as from two bull's-eyes
upon the forehatchway, the foot of the foremast, the
gallows-bitts abaft it, the scuttle-butt, and so forth.
</p>

<p>
These two lines of light had the effect of rendering
the rest of the deck dark, thus favouring the
purpose of Heriot, who reached unseen the forecastle,
and crept along it, until he found himself
close to the coaming of the scuttle, or small square
hatchway, which gave access thereto, and from
whence there ascended into the pure saline atmosphere
of the midnight sea a combination of odours
that were neither of Araby nor of Ind; for more
than a dozen of dirty, tarry, unwashed, and
uncombed specimens of those seamen usually denominated
"coloured," the most ruffianly of their class,
such, as may be seen lounging and loafing about the
quays and grog-shops of Liverpool and Birkenhead,
were all seated closely round a chest, which was
lashed by ringbolts to the deck, and formed the
table, whereon they had recently supped on
scalding-hot "scouse" from a greasy wooden kid; and
the fumes of this savoury mess yet mingled with
the tar with which their clothes were saturated, and
the coarse tobacco in which they were all indulging
freely, by means of pipes, quids, and cigarettes.
</p>

<p>
A ship's lantern, in which a candle sputtered,
shed a wavering light through the perforated tin
upon the black hair, massive frontal bones, and
square jaw of Pedro Barradas, and on his coarse,
leather-like ears, in which a pair of silver rings
were glittering; on the dark olive face of his
brother, Zuares, a villain of a more pleasing type,
only because he was younger and handsomer; on
the cruel, sardonic visage, the keen eyes, hooked
nose, and enormous chin, and tangled elf-locks of
Bill Badger, the long-legged and ungainly Yankee;
on the huge head and giant hands of the odious
Sharkey, who sat with his cheeks wedged between
his hands, his elbows planted on the chest, and his
eyes that, from under the bloody bandage encircling
his temples, glared at each speaker alternately; and
on all the rest of the ill-selected crew&mdash;fell the
lantern's dim uncertain ray, bringing some forward
into light, and leaving others almost in shadow.
</p>

<p>
Though quite sober, for as yet they had no means
for procuring alcohol, they generally all spoke at
once, and were engaged in an angry dispute, which,
however, they were still cautious enough to conduct
with suppressed voices.
</p>

<p>
Pedro Barradas grasped in his left hand an old
dice-box, which was served round with spunyarn,
and two suspicious-looking dice were rattled in it
from time to time.
</p>

<p>
At the moment that Heriot peeped in, it would
seem as if our Spanish acquaintance suddenly lost
his temper.  His black eyes filled with fire, his
swarthy cheek grew livid and pale, he showed all
his sharp white teeth like a dog about to bite, and
striking his drawn knife into the lid of the chest,
round which they were all grouped, and with a
force of action that made them all shrink back, he
uttered a tremendous oath, and said, in a low,
hoarse voice:
</p>

<p>
"It is agreed, then, that we take the ship, and
make all the people aft walk the plank.  Am I
to understand this?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes," from all hands was the reply; "and
all must walk the plank to leeward."
</p>

<p>
"Except the women," suggested the Canadian
seaman, named Bolter.
</p>

<p>
"In course we shall keep them!" said Badger,
laying a long and dirty finger on one side of his
hawk nose, and closing an eye wickedly; "and
take very partik'lar care o' the darlings, too."
</p>

<p>
"We take the ship," resumed Pedro Barradas,
speaking good English, and with an air of
authority; "and then we shall run her on her own
account."
</p>

<p>
"How?" asked one.
</p>

<p>
"In the slaving or piccarooning line, or anything
else that comes to hand."
</p>

<p>
"But where to?" asked the Canadian, who seemed
a man of doubts.
</p>

<p>
"Anywheres, darn your nutmeg of a head!"
growled the Yankee; "anywheres, arter we has
had a jolly spree ashore."
</p>

<p>
"On what shore, mate?"
</p>

<p>
"On the coast ov Africy, in course; but not
afore, mate&mdash;not afore, I calc'late."
</p>

<p>
"Come, now, I likes this," observed Sharkey,
putting in his voice; "if water and wittles runs
short, we may overhaul an Ingeeman, homeward-bound,
or an Australian liner&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"With sojers aboard, mayhap," said Bolter; "so
what will you dew then?"
</p>

<p>
"Hail or signal for a boat, to be sure, and sink it
to leeward with a cold shot through its ribs.  Shout
that it has been swamped under the counter, and to
send another, and another, and so knock 'em all on
the head.  Then run her aboard, take all out of
her&mdash;the women, too, if any&mdash;then scuttle or burn
her."
</p>

<p>
"A game you won't play long athout being
overhauled by some cussed man-o'-war," said the
Canadian.  "I tell you, mates, the good old piratical
times have been put out o' fashion long since.
Even the slaving business is knocked up by them
blazing smoke-jacks and gun-boats of the African
squadron.  The sea ain't wot it was, mates, when
old Kidd sailed the <i>Vulture</i> down the Channel with
a skull and marrow-bones flying at his foremasthead."
</p>

<p>
"Hooray!  I'll ship with you, Barradas," cried
another.  "Grog for the drinking, a grab at these
gals, and the pick o' the good things in the
passengers' trunks and cabin-lockers."
</p>

<p>
"And till that time comes," added Sharkey,
"we'll work Tom Cox's traverse with old Phillips&mdash;that
we shall.  Precious little work he'll get out
of me."
</p>

<p>
"But I don't like usin' the knife or plank if they
could be done athout, mates," said the Canadian
ponderingly.
</p>

<p>
"The Reverend Mr. Ben Bolter, a Methody
parson, 'll offer up a blessin' over the empty
mess-kids," sneered the Yankee.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Par todos santos</i>," growled Pedro Barradas,
giving the Canadian a glance of profound scorn,
while Zuares uttered a shrill and ferocious laugh.
</p>

<p>
"I say, cooky," said Sharkey, in a way which he
supposed to be very jocular, "as Ben Bolter don't
like the stickin' business, couldn't you put summut
tasty into the mess-kid o' the cabbin passingers,
and pison the whole bilin' o' them?  I have known
o' such things being done afore now, mates, and
many other things, too, that never appeared in the
ship's log.  Have you any Calabar beans aboard?"
</p>

<p>
"Yaas," replied the cook, with a regular negro
grin, for he was a black Virginian, named Quaco;
"dere's a bagful in de hold.  Why?"
</p>

<p>
"I have known of a handful, put in a copper of
peasoup, doing for a whole ship's crew afore now."
</p>

<p>
"When?"
</p>

<p>
"In the Gulf of Florida once, and again among
the Coral Islands, in the Pacific.  Aye, aye, mates,
I have seen some rum sprees in my time."
</p>

<p>
"And you are likely to see more," added the
Yankee, "ere this cussed old craft gets her anchors
over the bows, and her ground-tackle rove.  Ha, ha!
But as for the pison, you darned fool, wot of old
Basset's gals?  We wants 'em partik'lar, you know.
So avast with your Calabar beans.  I guess, mate,
you're up a tree, rayther."
</p>

<p>
Sharkey was abashed into silence.
</p>

<p>
"And that Scotch doctor," said a gaunt,
unhealthy-looking seaman, named Cribbit, who had
not yet spoken, and who so frequently required
Heriot's medical aid that he had imbibed half the
contents of his medicine-chest, "must he, too, walk
the plank?"
</p>

<p>
"In course he must," drawled Bill Badger, stuffing
an enormous quid in the inmost recesses of his
capacious mouth.
</p>

<p>
"No, no, <i>demonio</i>, no!" said the elder Barradas;
"we must keep him alive so long as we want him.
We can't physic ourselves, <i>companeros</i>, especially if
fever comes aboard, which it is likely to do if we
hug the land."
</p>

<p>
"But in physicking us he might poison the whole
blessed gang," suggested the Canadian.
</p>

<p>
"No fear of that.  We'll have him chained to
the mainmast, and if a man dies in his hands, then
<i>el senor doctor de medicena</i> shall be tipped overboard
after the others."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, my Spanish <i>patrone</i>," thought
Heriot, who had listened to all this with blood that
alternately boiled and curdled; "a pleasant little
medical practice you are likely to find me here!"
</p>

<p>
"Mayhap that fellow, Hawkshaw, would join us?"
suggested the Canadian again.
</p>

<p>
"He, the white-livered Perro!" exclaimed Pedro,
"I long to have my Albacete knife between his
ribs.  I'll teach him to play off quarter-deck airs
with me, the God-abandoned Piccaro!  Well, is it
agreed that, instead of letting old Phillips haul up
for Table Bay, we keep the ship off the land whether
he will or will not take her before we are abreast
of La Tierra de Natal; hug the coast of Africa
after; have a run through the Mozambique Channel,
and then stand right across the Indian Sea for
whatever we may overhaul?"
</p>

<p>
A unanimous clapping of very hard and very
dirty hands responded heartily to this programme.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Pedro, the <i>dados</i> (dice)," said Zuares,
impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, mates, the dice!" added the Yankee, setting
his chin, which was like a shoemaker's knife,
upon his knees, and clasping his hands over his
ankles, so that he squatted on his hams like a huge
baboon.  "Hooray! the old <i>Herminey</i> has been
trimmed by the starn since she saw Dungeness
Light; but we'll trim her by the head arter we
doubles the Cape&mdash;eh, mates?  So now to draw
lots for them two pretty creeturs, as I calculate is
just agoin' to bed about this blessed time.  Think
o' that, mates!  I'm a thorough-bred Yankee&mdash;half
bull, half shark, with an uncommon cross of the
snake; so I'm blowed if I can wait almost till we
leave Table Bay astarn and bear up towards Natal.
But rattle away, Pedro, my boy!&mdash;Captain Pedro
that is to be, I reckon."
</p>

<p>
The blood of the young Scotchman grew cold as
he listened, longing for a brace of loaded revolvers,
that he might shoot down the whole band; but
the talkative Yankee began his nasal drawling
again.
</p>

<p>
"How I'd like to have one of 'em under a big
palm-tree in some snug diggin' on the Africy coast,
or in a wigwam on the Mozambique, thatched with
leaves, no topsails to reef o' nights, and nothin'
to do all day, but keep on admiring her, and
swigging the grog old Phillips has aboard, or
blowing a whiff of 'baccy&mdash;eh, mates?
Jeerusalem! that's summut like life, I calculate!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Morte de Dios!</i>" swore Pedro Barradas, with
a very dark look; "haul in your slack, and be
hanged to you!  There are other things than the
two girls worth casting lots for!"
</p>

<p>
"Is there really, now?" drawled Badger.
I was looking into the senoras' cabin the other
night, and saw them going to bed.  I saw lovely
necks and shoulders, and all that; but I saw more,
I can tell you, <i>companeros</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Smite my timbers!" "Shiver my tawpsails!"
"Darn my eyes!" "Oh, Jeerusalem!"  And
"What did you see?" asked several all at once.
</p>

<p>
"A splendid jewel-case," replied the Spaniard,
while an avaricious gleam sparkled in his dark
eyes; "a box with diamond rings for the ears and
fingers; carbuncles, turquoises, and topazes, in
bracelets and necklets, all glittering on the trays
of blue and crimson velvet.  So he who loses the
girls should have a chance&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Of grabbing the jewels," interrupted Badger;
"in course he should&mdash;in course!"
</p>

<p>
"Jewels or not," said Zuares Barradas, laughing,
while he rolled up a fresh cigarito, "I'll teach one
senora, at least, that it is no longer here <i>mira y no
totas</i>, as they say in Minorca."
</p>

<p>
"Which means, in your cussed lingo?" asked Bolter.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Look</i> at me, but <i>touch</i> me not!" replied the
young Spaniard, with a grin.
</p>

<p>
"I'm rayther pertik'lar," observed Mr. Badger,
"and I might do neither one nor t'other, if I wor
in Minorky."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, mate; but if you saw the Minorca girls in
their robazillas of white lace or silk, pinned under
their pretty dimpled chins, and falling over their
shoulders, to be lifted at times by the wind, only as
if to show the low bodice and rounded bosom
beneath&mdash;<i>hombre</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Here is a sentimental young villain, with an
eye for the picturesque!" thought Heriot.
</p>

<p>
"Now, then, the dados," said Pedro, rattling the
dice-box.  "I throw myself first."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Maladetto</i>, Pedro!" interrupted Zuares.  "Content
yourself with rum and plunder; you are too
old and crank for either of these girls to be pleased
with you."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Vaya usted al Satanos!</i>" responded his affectionate
elder brother.  "The girls, at all events, are
not too young for me to be pleased with them.  I am
not more than forty, you son of a burnt castano."
</p>

<p>
"Take the old nurse, Pedro&mdash;you'll have her a
free gift, gratis, all for nothin', and Badger's
blessing into the bargain.  If one o' these gals falls to
me," continued the talkative Yankee, "I reckon I
must get shaved by the doctor, and be fixed anew;
have my 'air swabbed down with some o' the cook's
slush, and a hextra pull up o' my shirt collar&mdash;eh,
mates?"
</p>

<p>
Amid the ferocious laughter which these and
similar remarks drew forth, and while the dice-box
rattled on the sea-chest lid Dr. Heriot withdrew,
and crept aft, just as he had done forward, by
keeping close under the lee bulwarks.
</p>

<p>
Reaching the companion-way unseen, he slipped
downstairs, with a burning brain and aching heart&mdash;a
heart sick and sore with apprehension for others
rather than for himself; and now, with his ear
tingling with countless coarse oaths, obscenities, and
foul jokes, which, of course, have been omitted in
our relation of the remarkable discussion he had
overheard, he sought at once the cabin of Captain
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap07"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br /><br />
MEASURES FOR DEFENCE CONCERTED.
</h3>

<p>
Though Ethel and Rose had retired to rest, the hour
was not late, and Captain Phillips, Mr. Basset, and
Hawkshaw were still lingering over a glass of wine
in the cabin, when Dr. Heriot entered it.
</p>

<p>
The pallor of his face, and the excited expression
of his eyes, made them start with exclamations of
surprise and inquiry; and their alarm increased
when he filled up a glass with port and drained it,
the crystal rattling against his teeth while he did so.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo, doctor, what the deuce is the matter?"
asked bluff Captain Phillips, changing colour, or
rather losing it partially.  "You have been
forward&mdash;eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir; and have there heard more than
enough to confirm our worst fears."
</p>

<p>
Phillips arose, and closed the cabin door.  He
then summoned from his berth Mr. Quail (as Mr. Foster,
the second mate, had charge of the deck),
and they, together with Mr. Basset and Hawkshaw,
heard with undisguised consternation the result of
the doctor's eavesdropping.
</p>

<p>
As for Hawkshaw, he had long endured the
horrible conviction of guilt, with the still more
gnawing sense or dread of perpetual suspicion in
others.  He loved Ethel, yet, as we have said
elsewhere, at times he almost hated her for her coldness
to him; but now his soul was full of terror&mdash;terror
for her and for himself, as he knew he would meet
with little mercy from the Barradas and their
friends.  Retribution for the crime he had committed
at Acton Chine was about to come at last, and he
had fallen into a trap of his own devising!
</p>

<p>
Neither Captain Phillips nor Mr. Quail were much
astonished, though grieved and alarmed, by Dr. Heriot's
tidings; but poor Mr. Basset's first thought
was for his daughters&mdash;his young, delicate, and
tenderly-nurtured girls; and already, in his excited
imagination, he beheld them, after his own butchery,
in the rude grasp of those lawless wretches, and
subjected to the grossest indignities, far from help
or human aid, upon the lonely sea, and in a floating
hell&mdash;indignities the mere idea of which wrung the
poor man's heart with agony.
</p>

<p>
To-morrow, to-night, even now, they might be
advancing towards the cabin, intent on assassination
and robbery!
</p>

<p>
The dread was maddening to the unhappy parent,
who made a step towards his daughters' sleeping
place, as if in anticipation, by thought and deed, to
save them from the coming peril.  He had no voice
or coherence of thought for a time, and listened like
one in a dream to the discussion or consultation now
held by the officers of the ship.
</p>

<p>
After relinquishing his practice as a barrister in
London, Scriven Basset had spent many years of
ease and affluence at Laurel Lodge, and all unused
to alarms or excitements, he felt himself totally
destitute of the stamina or courage requisite for
facing so sudden and perilous an emergency.
Personal danger he might have confronted, for he
had all the spirit of a gentleman; but at the thought
of his daughters&mdash;the graceful and ladylike Ethel,
the sweet and playful Rose&mdash;his soul seemed to die
within him.
</p>

<p>
Cramply Hawkshaw's visage was paler than usual.
He remembered the threats used towards himself,
when Pedro Barradas so summarily appropriated his
gold watch, and while trembling for Ethel, he began
to think of means for quitting the ship, for the
safety of his own person, of which&mdash;being all the
property he possessed&mdash;he was rather disposed to be
economical.
</p>

<p>
"The accursed&mdash;the bloody-minded villains!"
exclaimed Captain Phillips, after a pause, while
pacing to and fro.  "This comes of having a
coloured crew; and this is why they have been so
sullen and insolent of late."
</p>

<p>
"And so lazy at work, too," groaned Mr. Quail.
</p>

<p>
"Lazy! they have done little else but take three
turns a day round the long-boat, and then a pull at
the scuttle-butt."
</p>

<p>
"For weeks there has been no work done,"
resumed Mr. Quail; "all our spunyarn and chafing-gear
are worn out, and you might as well expect
them to polish the chain-cable, or brighten up the
best bower, as prepare for an emergency, or get the
fellows even to wash or mend their own clothes."
</p>

<p>
"If a man-of-war hove in sight, I'd put an end to
their sogering!" said Captain Phillips, still pacing
about.  "I'd make them toe the mark, and work the
old iron out of them.  I'd have them all seized up,
and made spread-eagles of at the gangway, the
coloured vermin."
</p>

<p>
"A worse lot were never shipped, unless on board
a Spanish pirate," said Mr. Quail, with another
groan, as he thought of plump, jolly Mrs. Quail, and
their five little Quails, at that moment, doubtless all
a-bed in their pretty little rose-covered cottage near
the Windmill-hill at Gravesend.
</p>

<p>
"Is there not one on whom we could depend?"
asked Mr. Basset, in faltering accents.
</p>

<p>
"Not one, sir," replied Captain Phillips; "not
one, except Boy Joe, the steward, and he is not
worth much."
</p>

<p>
"We are in a desperate situation, certainly," said
Heriot.  "But I am most concerned for you and&mdash;and
your daughters, Mr. Basset."
</p>

<p>
Tears started to the lawyer's eyes, and he wrung
the young doctor's readily-proffered hand.
</p>

<p>
"And I, too, Mr. Basset, feel for you and your
two dear girls&mdash;though perhaps this business may
be all talk and sogering; yet I confess it don't look
like it," said the captain.  "Thank Heaven I am a
bachelor, and have no one depending upon me but
the son of my poor brother Bill, that was drowned
in the Straits of Sunda, and my life is insured on
his account, so that is all right; but these young
ladies&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Phillips paused, for Mr. Basset, who was reclining
on the cabin locker, covered his face with his hands,
and groaned aloud.
</p>

<p>
"We have no time to lose in preparing to meet
these rascals," said Dr. Heriot, with growing
confidence.  "We must see what arms we can muster,
and endeavour to use them too.  D&mdash;n it, Captain
Phillips, we must show fight in some fashion, and
not all walk the plank without making some of them
walk it also.  I have a pair of good rifled pistols."
</p>

<p>
"And I have two six-barrelled revolvers and a
fowling-piece," added the captain.
</p>

<p>
"Sixteen shots," said Hawkshaw, brightening a
little.  "We can barricade the cabin, and defend it
with these against them."
</p>

<p>
"We are seven, including myself," said Phillips.
</p>

<p>
"Seven?" said Mr. Basset, looking up.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir; there are the two mates, the doctor,
yourself, and I, Captain Hawkshaw, and Joe the
steward."
</p>

<p>
"But they are eighteen in number, and armed too."
</p>

<p>
"Only with sheath-knives, so far as we know;
but then there are hatchets, cleavers, handspikes,
and capstan-bars, with anything else that will form
a weapon."
</p>

<p>
"Oh that we were nearer the coast of Africa, that
we might all get into a boat, and quietly leave the
ship on a dark night!" said Mr. Basset, wringing
his hands, while Dr. Heriot unlocked a case of
pistols&mdash;the parting gift of his class-fellows on his
leaving the old College of King James VI.&mdash;and
proceeded at once to load and cap them, after which
he put all the ammunition in his pockets.
</p>

<p>
"Fear for your girls bewilders you, sir," said
Captain Phillips, in a low voice, to Mr. Basset.
"That, perhaps, is natural; but to be landed on the
coast of Africa might not mend matters much with
you and them, if you fell in with some houseless
Dutch bushmen or wild Cape Caffres; and as for
me, I shall never quit my ship while a plank of her
holds together."
</p>

<p>
"Captain Phillips," said young Heriot, with his
teeth clenched, and his eyes flashing, as he thought
of sweet Rose Basset, whose last kiss seemed yet to
linger on his lip, "if they keep quiet until morning,
I have a mind to call forward Pedro Barradas in
front of the crew, tell him what I have overheard,
and then, as an example, shoot him dead before the
rest!"
</p>

<p>
The captain vehemently opposed this idea as rash,
and added:
</p>

<p>
"You are very risky for a Scotsman; you would
only perish under the knives and handspikes of the
rest, and thus bring destruction the sooner on us all."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, if a man-o'-war would but come in sight!"
groaned Mr. Basset.
</p>

<p>
"They are seldom so far off the Cape; and we
are a good way to the southward of it already."
</p>

<p>
"Could we not sound the crew?  All may not be
so bad as the Barradas," said Hawkshaw.
</p>

<p>
"They are all alike, confound 'em!" rejoined
Captain Phillips, as he brought from his cabin the
two revolvers and the fowling-piece, all of which he
proceeded quietly, but quickly, to load and cap.
</p>

<p>
The arms and ammunition were distributed among
them, and Hawkshaw really handled the "six-shooter"
like a man who was used to it, and,
doubtless, when in Mexico, his life and his food had
frequently depended on the goodness of his aim.
</p>

<p>
"If we only take care and fire steadily, we may
dispose of them all in case of an attack," said
Dr. Heriot, who, with the captain, was the most resolute
of the little band.  "Our chief aim must be to
prevent a surprise."
</p>

<p>
After a council of war, it was arranged that the
ladies should be warned against leaving the cabin or
venturing much on deck, and that they should be
kept in ignorance of the why and wherefore.
</p>

<p>
That the seven men in the cabin should stand
staunchly by each other, and never undress when
lying in their berths, so as to be ready for instant
service.
</p>

<p>
That one at a time should hold a strict watch on
the companion-way and cabin door, and that all
should keep their arms loaded and their ammunition
constantly about them.
</p>

<p>
That as little canvas as possible should be kept
no the ship, so that aloft she might be ready for
any sudden emergency, squall, or catastrophe.
</p>

<p>
A large trunk, full of Mr. Basset's law-books
(which next morning was to have been shot into the
hold as lumber), was placed near the outer cabin
door, and lashed by one of its handles to a brass
ring-bolt, and so arranged that, sluing round the
other end, it effectually barricaded the sliding-door
that opened to the steerage and companion-ladder.
</p>

<p>
To defend this avenue in case of an attack, and
so sell their lives as dearly as possible, or, it might
be, to shoot all their assailants down in succession,
were the simple but stern resolutions come to.
</p>

<p>
These preliminaries adjusted, the captain, armed
with his revolver, took the first two hours' spell.
The rest retired to their various berths, and lay
down with their clothes on, and their weapons
beside them.
</p>

<p>
The two hours passed away in silence.
</p>

<p>
The captain went on deck, and sent the second
mate, Foster, below, in a not very enviable frame
of mind, after hearing what was on the <i>tapis</i>, for,
like Mr. Quail&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "He, poor fellow! had a wife and children&mdash;<br />
  Two things for dying people quite bewildering."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
So, with a beating and anxious heart, he lay down
on a locker, with a sharp hatchet under him&mdash;the
only weapon that came to hand.
</p>

<p>
The ship was still going large, with the breeze
abaft the beam, and the fore and main studding-sails
set.  Joe, the steward, was at the wheel; the
light in the forecastle bunks was extinguished now,
and the watch on deck were all grouped, in silence
apparently, to leeward of the long-boat.
</p>

<p>
All seemed still for that night, or rather the
remainder of the morning, when the captain warned
the miserable Mr. Basset to take the next "spell,"
or watch, as sentinel at the cabin door.
</p>

<p>
Pale and sleepless, with bloodshot eyes, the poor
man received the loaded revolver, with all the
timidity and awkwardness of one who had never
handled such a weapon before, and dreading lest it
might explode of its own accord, like a loaded
fire-wheel, and thus shoot himself and everybody else;
but anon the thought of his daughters nerved his
heart and steadied his hand.
</p>

<p>
Slowly, as if Time stood still, the minutes passed;
and when, as usual, the ship's bell clanged at each
half-hour on deck, it sounded in his ears and in his
soul like the knell of doom!
</p>

<p>
So the poor father continued to watch in
breathless anxiety; now pacing the carpeted cabin in
miserable restlessness, then seating himself upon
the stern locker, with the revolver on his knee, and
his hands over his face, breathing an unuttered
prayer for his darling daughters; now listening,
keenly as a hunted hare, at the door of their little
cabin, to hear their soft, low breathing.  Anon,
seeking the companion-way, as if the confined air
of the ship stifled him, and looking up at the
mizzen-rigging towering into the starry sky, where the
mizzen-topsail, topgallantsail, and the driver, with
the boom and gaff, spread between him and heaven
like a broad gray cloud of canvas.
</p>

<p>
Then the thought of his dead wife, and their once
dear happy home in England far away.
</p>

<p>
By a freak of memory, past hours of happiness, of
joviality and frivolity&mdash;hours spent amid the flowery
and leafy seclusion of Laurel Lodge, came crowding
on him, with faces of friends, their voices, smiles,
and little episodes; the green sunny lawn, the stately
chase of Acton-Rennel, the Norman cross on Cherrytree
Hill, and the great yew that shaded his wife's
grave in that quiet old English churchyard, where he
might never lie: all these came before him now, and
he marvelled in his aching breast if the horrors that
overhung him now were not a nightmare, and all a
dreadful dream!
</p>

<p>
Ethel and Rose, so pure, so fair, so lovely, and so
highly bred, to be in such peril; at the mercy of such
men as those who formed the crew of the <i>Hermione</i>,
and far from all human succour on the wide, wide,
open sea.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><br />
THE SAIL TO WINDWARD.
</h3>

<p>
Under the interlaced crosses of Great Britain&mdash;our
brave old union-jack&mdash;a very different crew
manned that good little ship the <i>Princess</i>, of London,
which we last left when dropping the giant cone of
Tristan d'Acunha astern, and bearing on her voyage
towards Tasmania.
</p>

<p>
Under Tom Bartelot's command, all went well
and prosperously, and his ship had fine weather and
spanking topsail breezes, after leaving the romantic
Isle of Tristan.
</p>

<p>
Anxious to be useful and to kill time, Morley
Ashton had applied himself to seamanship, and, in
seeking to master all the mysteries thereof, became
the peculiar pupil of old Noah Gawthrop, who
confidently undertook "to make a man and a sailor of
him, before they saw Wan Demon's Land."
</p>

<p>
He could soon dip his hands in a bucket of tar
without wincing; slush the mast, from the
royal-masthead down, without becoming squeamish; he
could box the compass, take his trick at the helm,
and achieve many clever things, from holding the
log-reel upwards to sending down a royal-yard
without mistake or blunder, which Noah told him
"was one of the prime feats of seamanship, which
even the queen on the throne couldn't do."
</p>

<p>
The first time he accomplished this, was when a
squall was coming on.  Ben Plank had the fore-royal,
Noah the main-royal, and Morley the mizzen.
</p>

<p>
His spar was certainly the lightest, with a smaller
sail, but he had it struck and sent down before the
others, greatly to the delight of old Noah, who, with
all his ugliness, which was undeniable, was a genuine
salt of the old school&mdash;a regular British tar, with his
slouching shoulders and light gait, swinging arms,
and half-closed hands, that were always ready to
"tally on" to anything; a comical twinkle in his
eye, and who believed in whistling for wind as truly
as the Turkish skipper who pours oil upon the sea,
in the hope that it may float to Mecca, for the
same useful purpose.
</p>

<p>
Noah bore on his breast, engraved in gunpowder,
a little romance of his younger days&mdash;a sailor and a
girl standing on the sea-shore.  In the background
(or offing, to speak more correctly) lay a ship, with
her topsails loose, hove-apeak to her anchor, while
the smoke from a gun&mdash;the signal for sea&mdash;curled
over her quarter.  Under the male figure were the
initials "N.G.," and under the girl's were&mdash;what
we won't say, for in them, lay the pet secret of old
Noah's honest heart.  The ship, however, he often
pointed to with pride, saying it was a "lovely
pictur' of her Majesty's ship the <i>Haurora</i>, of fifty
guns, as was&mdash;an ugly smoke-jack now, with a
screw-propeller in her starn."
</p>

<p>
The weather was cool, almost cold, at times, and
frequently icebergs were in sight, with their white
glistening pinnacles standing sharply defined against
the sky, and shaded off with pale green or purple
tints, that blended with the deep blue of the sea.
</p>

<p>
Tom Bartelot's cheerful temperament, his songs
and his bonhomie, and Morrison's queer legends of
Scotland and the sea, together with grave and
earnest advice, and confidence in a Providence who
ordered all things for the best, had a good effect
upon Morley Ashton's spirits, which might have
sunk, circumstanced as he was, amid the monotony
of a sea voyage, with foreshadowed fears of evil
tidings on reaching the Isle of France, after making
a tour so circuitous as Tasmania.
</p>

<p>
Ignorant of the unlooked-for detention of the
<i>Hermione</i> at the Canaries, and of the series of foul
winds she had encountered, Morley never doubted
that now the Bassets must have reached their
destination, and been installed in their new home;
that Mr. Basset must have entered on his official
duties, and if they were accompanied by one so
enterprising as Cramply Hawkshaw, it was difficult
to foretell how Cupid and Fortune&mdash;blind deities
both&mdash;might reward his perseverance, and thus cast
a fatal blight upon the hopes of our hero who, like
a poor "pilgrim of the heart," or a knight-errant
of old, was traversing the sea from shore to shore in
search of a lost love.
</p>

<p>
One day, as Morley trod the deck to and fro
listlessly, he was startled by the unusual, or, at
least, unexpected cry of&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Land, ho!"
</p>

<p>
Telescope in hand, he sprang up the weather-rigging.
</p>

<p>
"Land it is, indeed," said Tom Bartelot, shading
his eyes with his hand, and peering over the
weather-quarter.
</p>

<p>
"What land, Tom?"
</p>

<p>
"Diego Alvarez, or Gough's Island.  I have
been looking out for it all forenoon.  Keep her full
and by&mdash;full and by, lad," he added to the steersman;
"keep her closer to the wind&mdash;see how that
foretopsail shivers."
</p>

<p>
This was about six bells (<i>i.e.</i>, 3 P.M.) on a fine,
clear afternoon.  The hill of Gough's Island arose
dim and blue upon their weather-bow.
</p>

<p>
Discovered long, long ago, by an adventurous
Portuguese mariner, who bestowed upon it its name,
it is a lonely and desolate place, covered with moss
and sea-grass, the abode only of sea-elephants and
the fur-seal.  It was named anew by Captain Gough,
of the <i>Richmond</i>, when on his voyage to China in 1731.
</p>

<p>
After leaving it astern, good fortune seemed to
abandon the <i>Princess</i> and her crew.
</p>

<p>
A series of foul winds that veered round every
point of the compass, with heavy gusts and squally
weather, beset her, and so cloudy was the sky, that
for several days Bartelot and his mate were quite
unable to make an observation&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, to take the
sun's altitude at noon.
</p>

<p>
In one squall the mizzen-topniast was carried
away, being broken right off at the cap, the heel
with the fid alone remaining in the top.
</p>

<p>
"So, friend Morley," said Tom, "if this kind of
work and these foul winds continue, we may see the
Table Mountain, and have to run into the bay for
fresh water."
</p>

<p>
"At the Cape of Good Hope?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Then if you wish to have a day's run in
Lubberland, you may come ashore with me; and
who can say," he added, kindly, on perceiving
how Ashton's countenance fell at the prospect of
fresh delays, "but we may there find a craft bound
for the island of Paul and Virginia, and get your
hammock swung aboard of her at once?"
</p>

<p>
One day the weather cleared a little, and the sun
broke forth a few minutes before noon.
</p>

<p>
Bartelot and Morrison betook them to quadrant,
sextant, and chart, and found they were within
some 300 miles of the Cape of Storms.
</p>

<p>
After this the sky resumed its sombre and inky
hue; the sea was gray, save where the sun shot his
beams like a flood of yellow light through a rent in
the clouds, and lit the waves below with a golden
sheen, long and steadily, about fifteen miles distant
on their weather-bow.
</p>

<p>
"Sail, ho!" shouted Ben Plank, who, with some
others, was up aloft taking advantage of this bright
blink, to get the spare mizzen-topmast shipped, with
all its hamper and gearing.
</p>

<p>
"Where away, Ben?" asked Morley, snatching
Tom's telescope from its brass hooks under the
companion-hatch.
</p>

<p>
"There, sir, in that streak of light to windward."
</p>

<p>
Looming large as coming out of the haze, Morley
saw a large, square-rigged vessel, with all her
fore-and-aft canvas set, running close-hauled on a
different current of wind, which did not as yet affect
the <i>Princess</i>, and which would probably carry her
ahead.
</p>

<p>
Her canvas was white as snow, and shone like
the outspread wings of a swan in the bright gleam
of sunshine, and in strong relief against the gray
and dusky sky beyond.
</p>

<p>
She was visible but for a few minutes&mdash;so briefly,
indeed, that Morrison had not time to run the ensign
up to the gaff-peak, when she seemed to dart into
the gray obscurity ahead, and to vanish like a
phantom that melted into the sky; but though
invisible, it was evident that the <i>Princess</i>, a faster
sailer, would soon leave her far astern.
</p>

<p>
In that large square-rigged ship, that spanked
along on a taut bowline, with the white foam
curling under her black bows, and flying over her
gilded catheads, how little Morley Ashton imagined
that Ethel Basset&mdash;the Ethel of his hopes by day
and dreams by night, the centre around which all
his aspirations and his life itself revolved&mdash;was
seated side by side with Hawkshaw on one of the
quarter-deck seats, watching, through a fifteen-mile
lorgnette, or racing-glass, the outline of the
<i>Princess</i>, whose canvas being all in shadow came
blackly out, for a few minutes, from the sombre
atmosphere to leeward, and then melted from their
view for ever.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap09"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br /><br />
THE STORM.
</h3>

<p>
Varied by occasional torrents of rain, black, cloudy,
and squally skies, the regular "Cape weather"
continued after this, and the <i>Princess</i> was soon
running under close-reefed topsails.  So frequently
were the reefs taken in and shaken out, that Bill
Morrison said they reminded him of an old Scottish
seaman's rhyme:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Gif the rain pouirs ere the wind swurl,<br />
  Your topsails lowse and gar them furl;<br />
  But gif the wind blaws ere pouirs the rain,<br />
  Your topsails lowse, and hoist again."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Even the gay spirit of Tom Bartelot became
depressed by the gloomy and threatening state of
the weather, and he spent nearly his whole time on
deck, or in observing the compasses, the barometer,
and state of the pumps.
</p>

<p>
Two days after the strange sail had been seen no
the weather-bow, the glass was still falling, while
the sea and wind were rising.
</p>

<p>
At seven bells, after taking a hurried breakfast
Tom found the wind increasing to a gale, so he took
in the maintopgallantsail, the second reef of his
topsails, and set the mainstaysail.
</p>

<p>
By midday he had to summon all hands on deck.
</p>

<p>
"Close-reef the topsails, furl mainsail and fore
and mizzen-topsail."
</p>

<p>
These orders followed each other rapidly.
</p>

<p>
Soon after, the <i>Princess</i> was flying through the
gloomy sea under a close-reefed maintopsail and
reefed foresail, shipping a great deal of water the
while, and labouring hard, as her pumps worked
ill.
</p>

<p>
After this, the wind began to die away, the sea
went somewhat down, and then more canvas was
spread on the ship; but there were many indications
in the sky and atmosphere which filled Tom
and Morrison, and Gawthrop, too, for he had his
nameless nautical instincts, with anxieties which the
younger men of the crew could not fail to perceive.
</p>

<p>
"How's the barometer, Morrison?" was the
frequent question.
</p>

<p>
"Still falling slowly, sir."
</p>

<p>
"What do you think the night will be?" asked Morley.
</p>

<p>
"There's a gloom, and a closeness too, indicating
thunder."
</p>

<p>
"Aye," said Noah Gawthrop, who had the
wheel, "the wind and the sea will make a fine
bobbery together in these parts afore the morning
watch, is called."
</p>

<p>
"Steward&mdash;Ben Plank, get the dead lights
shipped," cried Bartelot, "here comes the squall
again!  In with all the light sails, Morrison;
hurry forward&mdash;'way aloft lads, and lay out on the
yards!"
</p>

<p>
Thus, by six o'clock, she was again running
under close-reefed topsails and foresail.
</p>

<p>
The clouds were banking up in strange, wild,
and fantastic forms to windward; black and
sombre, they were altering every moment,
revealing weird-like patches of white and livid sky
beyond.  At some parts of the horizon the blended
sea and sky had the darkness of night, while in the
zenith there was at times the brightness almost of
noon.
</p>

<p>
"I don't like the aspect of all this, Morley," said
Bartelot, in a low voice to his friend; "we are in for
a rough, wild night, and I wish it were well past."
</p>

<p>
The wind veered rapidly round half of the compass;
sometimes it seemed to blow from all quarters
at once.  It came in strong and hot gusts, while,
through the bosom of the black clouds at the
horizon, the red lightning seemed to plunge its
seething bolts in the sea, and to add to the sublime
terror of such a scene; the atmosphere was so
sulphurous that, at times, luminous lights like fireballs
or meteors were seen on every masthead, yardarm,
and beam-end.
</p>

<p>
"Furl the topsails, lower the yards upon the cap,
leave nothing set but the close-reefed foresail,"
were now Bartelot's orders.
</p>

<p>
Morley had never before seen so wild a tempest;
but he was now seaman enough to scramble aloft
with the rest, and soon found himself on the foot-rope,
and "laying out" on the arm of the main-yard,
and, as he was first up at the weather-earring, there
holding on with all his strength, for so weird
was the scene below, the napping of the canvas,
the snapping of ropes, that cracked like
coach-whips in the bellowing wind, the swaying of the
rigging, and the pitching of the ship, that a terrible
nausea came over him, together with a giddiness,
and had not a seaman, named Erwin, who was by
his side, caught him, he might have toppled into the
sea, that roared and seethed below.
</p>

<p>
Ben Plank, being a strong fellow, had his post in
the slings of the mainyard, to pack the sail, and
make up the bunt, or stow the heavy middle
portion.  Soon all was snug aloft; but again the wind
changed so rapidly, that it flew round from the
south-east to the north-west, and then with a
mighty sound of rending and tearing, the foresail
was split to ribbons, that flapped and cracked like
rifle shots in the tempest, while the ship, which
seemed almost enveloped in lightning for an instant,
was almost thrown on her beam-ends.
</p>

<p>
"Stand from under, men&mdash;there go the masts!"
shouted Bartelot through his trumpet, and a
stunning peal of thunder bellowed over the ocean
at the same moment.
</p>

<p>
Then followed a mighty crash, as if the heavens
were falling on the deck, and all shrunk instinctively
aside, or stooped downward, as the three topmasts
and jib-boom broke off at the caps, and the <i>Princess</i>
was a wreck in a moment.
</p>

<p>
"Hatchets&mdash;cut away the hamper to ease the
ship!" was now the order, and, in a short time, the
tangled wilderness of yards, masts, cross-trees and
blocks, stays and rigging, on being cut adrift,
whirled out of sight to leeward, carrying with it the
unfortunate seaman Erwin, who had been caught
by the body in the bight of a rope.
</p>

<p>
By the fall of the mizzen-topniast the starboard
quarter-boat was dashed to pieces, and the other,
which was a life-boat, was torn from its davits and
vanished in the darkness like a child's toy, as a
tremendous sea pooped the ship.
</p>

<p>
"Tom," gasped Morley, as he clung, half-drowned,
or stunned, to a belaying-pin, "are we indeed
lost&mdash;do you think all is over?"
</p>

<p>
"Nearly so&mdash;if this continues long," was the
composed reply.  "Hold on, lads, here comes another sea!"
</p>

<p>
Now the black waves continued to burst over the
vessel with a series of thundering explosions, as if
determined to overwhelm it, till all around was
foam, as white as snow; but though labouring at
times with her gunwale almost under water, her
whole deck strewed with fragments and splinters of
timber, bulwarks, buckets, pieces of rope, blocks,
sails, and spars, that were washed to and fro, and
while the crew, knee-deep in this debris, clung to
shrouds and belaying-pins, she rose up buoyantly
ever and anon, on the crest of a wave, with all the
water streaming from her, and all the while the wild
wind blew in gusts, and bellowed like an unchained
fiend.  Amid the terrible scene another seaman was
swept overboard and drowned; the long-boal was
uprooted from its lashings and chocks over the
main-hatch, and carried over the side, by a sea that came
right amidships, and tore away half the starboard-bulwarks,
so, fearing that the ship would founder,
Bartelot, with a heavy heart, gave orders to cut
away the lower masts.
</p>

<p>
The men were soon at work with sharp axes, and,
while keeping afoot with difficulty under the
drenching seas, shipped every moment by the labouring
hull, after cutting through the shrouds and stays, a
few blows at the foot of each mast, readily sent
them, in succession, crashing to leeward, where they
vanished amid foam and obscurity.
</p>

<p>
Noah Gawthrop had just relinquislied the now
useless wheel, when a wave broke over the quarter,
tearing the rudder from its bands, and dashing the
wheel to pieces.
</p>

<p>
"All's over with the poor <i>Princess</i>, Morley," said
Tom, with a groan; "she won't outlive the night,
I fear."
</p>

<p>
Morrison now came aft to report that the chain-pump
had given way, the other had become choked,
and that water was rising fast in the well.
</p>

<p>
"She's sprung a leak, sir, somewhere about her
fore-foot, so it is a bad look-out for us all," said
Plank, the carpenter.
</p>

<p>
By this time the bulwarks were all torn away
from the stanchions and timber-heads amidships by
the sea, which now made clean breaches over the
entire hull.
</p>

<p>
Nothing could be done now by the crew, but to
leave the ship to her fate, and to hold on by whatever
offered itself, and wait the event of the storm
abating, or, what seemed much more likely, of the ship
foundering, by settling bodily down into the trough
of the sea, and rising never more.  Her cargo, too,
sugar and tobacco, were the reverse of buoyant
under the circumstances; so now, Morley, Bartelot,
Morrison, the chief mate, Plank, the carpenter, and
old Noah, were all grouped about the quarter-deck,
some holding on by the timber-heads, others by the
stump of the mizzenmast, while the rest of the crew
were grouped forward, where they lashed themselves
to the stump of the foremast, the barrel of the
windlass, and gallows-bitts; but so dark was the
night, so terrible the sea, and so loud the wind, that
neither party could see or hear anything of the
other.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly there was a rending crash!
</p>

<p>
An invocation of heaven rose to the lips of all, and
a wild, despairing cry from those in the forecastle
reached the ears of our friends on the quarter-deck.
Morley felt the whole ship tremble beneath his feet,
as the entire quarter was burst up, or torn away
from the rest of the hull, and with his companions
he found himself floating on it, as on a species of
raft, and up to his neck in water every moment,
while whirled away from the ship, of which they
saw no more, and which, no doubt, went speedily
down with all on board.
</p>

<p>
Just as this happened, Plank, the carpenter, was
swept away, clutching with despair a fragment of
wreck.
</p>

<p>
On this frail remnant of the shattered ship, the
other four unfortunates found themselves adrift on
that wild, dark midnight sea, which whirled it to and
fro like a cork on the black, tempestuous waves.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br /><br />
THE FOUR CASTAWAYS.
</h3>

<p>
"Lord have mercy on us!" escaped the lips of all.
</p>

<p>
It would seem that, by the strength and violence
of the sea, the entire quarter-deck abaft the mizzen-mast,
with a portion of its bulwarks, the taffrail, some
parts of the stern windows and quarter galleries,
had been torn from the ship, and this crazy
fragment was all that intervened between our four
friends and eternity.
</p>

<p>
Being level with the sea it could not be capsized,
which, at least, was one good property.
</p>

<p>
Lashed to such parts of it as were available, the
poor victims clung there in desperation and silence,
waiting, and praying in their hearts that the storm
would abate; and now, as if its errand had been
done, its object accomplished in the total destruction
of the unfortunate <i>Princess</i>, the gusty wind began
to lull gradually, though the agitated sea rolled
high and black as ever.
</p>

<p>
As the common saying has it, the waves "ran
mountains high;" but it must be borne in mind,
that few waves rise more than ten feet above the
general level of the water, which, when ten more
are given for the trough of the sea, makes the
whole height from base to crest twenty
feet&mdash;sufficiently high to be terrible in aspect and effect.
</p>

<p>
Over the raft of the <i>Princess</i> (for it was little
better) those vast hills of water made a thundering
breach every instant, or came surging up through
the apertures, from whence the companion and
skylight had been torn away.
</p>

<p>
The taffrail was strong, and it was chiefly to it
that Bartelot, Morley, Morrison, and Gawthrop lashed
themselves, for gradually all that remained of the
bulwarks were torn away, and the stump of the
mizzenmast was soon worked or sucked out by the
sea.
</p>

<p>
There was an appalling sense of loneliness, of
dread and desolation, and of too probable death
being near at hand, though, perhaps, all the more
terrible, if it were protracted.
</p>

<p>
So the fearful night wore on; the black scud was
passing away, the stars shone out, and the four
castaways began to hope that morning was at hand.
Yet, ruthlessly, wave after wave came rolling over
them, each with its high and monstrous head,
curling white with snowy foam, though its sides were
black and inky.  Then there would be a roar as of
thunder when each burst over the fragment of wreck,
engulfing and half choking the poor dripping
wretches who clung to it in silence and despair.
</p>

<p>
But now, as dawn, began to spread rapidly over
the east, the sea went down, and the wind also; the
waves ceased to roll over the broken deck, which
floated steadily, and as it rose upheaved on each
successive swell, the occupants cast around them,
eager glances from their bloodshot eyes, in the hope
of descrying a sail.
</p>

<p>
Dawn came thoroughly in&mdash;a cloudy morning, but
no sunshine.  Ere long they could see the whole
horizon; but there no vestige of a sail was visible,
and now they looked blankly in each other's pallid
faces.
</p>

<p>
"My poor crew!" said Bartelot, with a thick sob
in his throat, but the exclamation had escaped him
many times before; "second-mate, carpenter,
sail-maker, steward, cook, boys, and all&mdash;all gone but
us, Morley.  Sad&mdash;deplorable, is it not?"
</p>

<p>
"Do not grieve for what is irreparable," said
Morrison.
</p>

<p>
"If I saw you, Bill Morrison, my friend Ashton,
and my old shipmate Noah, all safe, I don't care
if I were shark-meat this minute," he resumed,
bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"Don't say so, Bartelot, my old boy," replied
Morley, with an affectation of spirit he was far from
feeling: "you have behaved bravely, and done all
that man could do to save your ship.  Take courage;
you have buoyed me up many a day, when my
heart had sunk to zero.  Let me try to cheer you in
turn."
</p>

<p>
"Cheer!" Tom repeated, shaking his head sadly,
and still more bitterly, as he surveyed their home
upon the waters.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Heaven! to think of this being a bit of the
old <i>Princess</i> we all loved so well!" groaned
Morrison, looking almost affectionately on the frail
planks over which the sea rippled at every heave.
</p>

<p>
"Aye, sir," chimed in Noah; "it are odd, but it
was a bit of that same blessed deck, as was
holystoned and prayer-booked, swabbed and squilgeed
of a morning till it were white as snow&mdash;whiter
a'most than the deck of her Majesty's yacht.  I've
poured half the sea over that deck, I have, when
the head-pump was rigged for'ard of a morning,
and now what is it, but only a bit of drift-wood,
and we a clinging to it, like four wet barnacles?
Lor' help us!"
</p>

<p>
"And bless our poor shipmates!" added Bartelot,
pointing upwards.
</p>

<p>
"They are all gone, sir&mdash;found sailors' graves,
every one of them," said Morrison; "the ship
would fill, and go down the moment she parted
aft."
</p>

<p>
"But you've done your duty, sir," said Noah;
"and can clear yourself of the ship's loss before any
naval court in any part of the world.  I only wish
we were all afore one this blessed minute, instead o'
drifting about here, without compass, biscuit, or
'bacca."
</p>

<p>
Now came the oppressive reflection that they
were without food and without water.
</p>

<p>
Morley had read very recently the "Paul Huet"
of Eugene Sue, and the more true story on which
his romance is founded&mdash;the awful wreck of the
<i>Medusa</i>, French frigate, and thus the horrors which
her crew endured upon the raft came vividly and
painfully before him now.
</p>

<p>
The saline property of the atmosphere, their long
and repeated immersions in the ocean, the quantities
of its water they had been compelled to swallow
when the drenching waves broke over them, soon
excited thirst.  This longing was increased by heat,
when the sun came forth; but as yet they had no
desire for food.
</p>

<p>
All their energies were bent on watching the
horizon around them, but no sail appeared; so
the wreck continued to float listlessly about,
without making way apparently in any direction.
</p>

<p>
A boat they might have rowed in the direction of
the Cape of Good Hope, and though they might
have failed to reach the coast, while minus food
and water, they would always have increased their
chances of being picked up by a passing ship,
homeward or outward bound; but on the wreck they
were helpless, as if upon a desert rock fixed amid
the sea.
</p>

<p>
The first day passed slowly, wearily on, and the
sun verged westward in his course.
</p>

<p>
Now night descended on the sea.  There was no
moon, but the stars shone clearly and sharply.
</p>

<p>
Worn by emotion, by toil, suffering, and lack of
sleep, they trusted to the security of their lashings,
and strove to find rest, or oblivion, in slumber; but
a half-wakeful doze was all they could achieve.
Each body lay, to all appearance, torpid; but the
anxious soul slept not, so each had his own keen
active thoughts and dreams.
</p>

<p>
Tom Bartelot conjured up a certain pretty little
English face, whose smiling blue eyes were
associated with many a summer evening walk among the
sylvan scenery of Richmond Park, in the gardens of
Kew, and visits to Hampton Court.
</p>

<p>
Morrison's heart was in his old mother's cottage,
where he first saw the light, by the broad waters of
the Dee, that roll from the hills of Crathie and
Braemar in "the bonnie north country;" for he
had intended, at the close of another voyage, to go
home to Scotland, with all his earnings and wages,
to spend them with her, and for her only; but all
that seemed hopeless now, though the hum of the
sea in his ears, as it rippled against the wreck,
suggested the surf that in boyhood he had seen
breaking over the Black Dog of Belhelvie.*
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
* A rock on the Aberdeenshire coast, so named from its
appearance at low water.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Poor old Gawthrop, with his grizzled whiskers,
and lips baked in dry salt, dreamt of neither father,
mother, nor love&mdash;for all who loved old Noah
were dead long ago; but he had a vision of a stiff
jorum of
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Boatswain's grog&mdash;just half and half,"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
such as he used to get in the <i>Haurora</i>, of fifty guns;
while Morley Ashton thought, and dreamed, and
murmured to himself of Ethel Basset.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Absence makes the heart grow fonder."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
He had now been long absent from Ethel, and
been long mourned by her as one who was lost to
her for ever, and numbered with the dead.  And
now death menaced him again!
</p>

<p>
He had been saved from destruction by his
friend&mdash;saved from a death by starvation, or despair,
at Acton Chine; but only to perish with him here
amid the lonely waters of the South Atlantic; for
this time it seemed that he was too surely doomed
to die&mdash;an idea rendered all the more bitter by a
conviction that Ethel would never, and could never,
know the dark story of his disappearance, for no
mortal lips could tell her save those of Hawkshaw.
</p>

<p>
Morley felt that he might perish now; that she
would never learn the true character of his rival;
of his own awful escape from Acton Chine; of his
journey to Rio de Janeiro; of his sufferings on the
raft, till relieved by death; of how he had been
tossed hither and thither by fortune's unrelenting
hate, and how deeply and devotedly he loved her.
</p>

<p>
By this last misfortune, the wreck, more than all
the others, he might, by dying, leave her to become
the wife of Hawkshaw, the would-be assassin!
</p>

<p>
So another night passed over, and the raft, or
wreck, still floated darkly, silently there; and now
those who were thereon had ceased to speak, even in
whispers.
</p>

<p>
Another day dawned&mdash;a day of glorious sunshine;
but no food, no water, no hope came with it; for
not a sail was in sight, and their eyes ached with
weariness in searching the faint blue watery line
that marked where the sky and ocean met.
</p>

<p>
They were becoming very feeble now, and the
cravings of nature were maddening.
</p>

<p>
Their hair was encrusted by salt, as white as
hoar-frost, their lips were baked, their tongues parched.
Already they had become gaunt and white, hollow-cheeked,
and old-looking, with eyes bloodshot and wild.
</p>

<p>
Their feet and legs were sore and sodden by long
immersion in the brine, and their whole bodies were
rendered stiff and weary by the wet ropes which
lashed them to the taffrail&mdash;a means of security
which they dared not unloose or relinquish for a
moment.
</p>

<p>
Ere long they were in a species of delirium.
</p>

<p>
Hunger brought its own fantastic and exciting
suggestions of well-cooked viands, of hearty homely
dishes, steaming and savoury, roasts and stews,
puddings and pies; but thirst, agonising thirst,
suggested ideas of cool rivers, amid which snows
were dissolving; of lonely mountain tarns, where
the brown trout sported under the broad-leaved
water-docks, and where the wild bird swam; of
glassy meres, of crystal rills, that murmured under
old oak trees, or shady drooping willows, with dark
green sprays, and water-lilies that dipped therein;
of iced champagne, that effervesced in crystal
goblets; of sparkling hock and seltzer-water; of
jolly London stout, all brown, with its creamy froth;
of every impossible luxury that they had not, and
never more might feel upon their cracked lips and
dry, hard, arid tongues!
</p>

<p>
A dead bird!&mdash;it was a huge albatross, with
wings outspread&mdash;floated slowly past them on the
glassy oil-like sea, thus indicating a current that
ran eastward.
</p>

<p>
They were all too weak to attempt to swim for
it; so, wolfishly, with haggard eyes and longing
appetites they watched the wretched carrion for
hours, until it floated out of sight.
</p>

<p>
Then three nautilus shells, with purple sails
outspread, passed near them, and, to Morley's excited
vision, they seemed like large Roman galleys, or
fairy barges; at a vast distance&mdash;such craft as he
had read of in legends of the Rhine, in fairy tales,
and knightly ballads.
</p>

<p>
And now came Mother Carey's chickens, hopping
and tripping about the wreck, and on the ripples
round it&mdash;merrily and happily, like brown sparrows
in a farmyard at home.
</p>

<p>
About the setting of the sun, they were roused
from their listlessness by the sudden apparition of
a large vessel, barque-rigged&mdash;that is, with the
fore and mainmasts of a ship and a mizzen like a
schooner's mainmast, with a long spanker-boom&mdash;bearing
down towards them.
</p>

<p>
There was a fine breeze blowing; she had all her
canvas set, and ran on a taut bowline.
</p>

<p>
"A ship! a sail! a sail!" they exclaimed together.
</p>

<p>
"Now, blessed be Heaven!" said Tom, "we are
saved at last!  Hurrah&mdash;hurrah!"
</p>

<p>
She was painted a kind of yellowish white; her
side chains and hawse-holes, and all her iron work,
looked red and rusty, as if she had been long in
tropical waters.
</p>

<p>
With almost inarticulate lips they sought to hail
her, and waved their hands in frantic glee as she
came on, with the white foam curling under her
bluff bows, where the old copper was green, and
covered with barnacles.  Her side was lined with
the faces of her crew, who seemed to be in earnest
conference, and some of whom gesticulated violently.
</p>

<p>
She seemed to be foreign by her build and rig,
as well as by the scarlet and blue shirts and fur
caps of her men.
</p>

<p>
Now she was close to them, and the white flag,
with the black eagle of Prussia, was hoisted at her
gaff peak; now she would certainly be hove in the
wind, with a mainsail laid aback, and have a boat
lowered to relieve them.
</p>

<p>
So close was she, that the wheel revolved to keep
her away a point or two, lest she might run the frail
wreck under with her bluff bows, as she sheered
past.
</p>

<p>
Tom hailed in English "to relieve them from
misery&mdash;to save them, for the love of mercy and of
God!"
</p>

<p>
He spoke imploringly, for a sudden doubt had
chilled his heart.
</p>

<p>
Hoarsely the hail was responded to in German,
and the barque passed on&mdash;on, without lifting tack
or sheet, without lowering a boat, or tossing a single
biscuit, to those four men who were all but dying on
the wreck!  The Prussian&mdash;she was the <i>Einicheit</i>, of
Dantzic&mdash;stood away on her course, and left Bartelot
and his three friends in an agony of disappointment
and despair that bordered on madness!*
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
* For the infamous conduct of this Prussian crew to a Scottish
ship in distress, see any paper of May 26, 1864.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
With such terrible emotions in their hearts, as no
pen could portray, they saw her slowly diminish in
distance, and vanish into the yellow haze that
overspread the evening sea.  Then once more night
descended on the world of waters, and again they were
alone&mdash;more alone, they felt, than ever, for even
their fellow-beings had abandoned them.
</p>

<p>
During all that night Morley Ashton was delirious.
</p>

<p>
Dreams and thoughts of Acton Chase and woods,
that rustled their green leaves in the soft west wind;
of golden fields, of bearded grain, that waved like
yellow billows beneath its breath; of the voices of
the larks that soared aloft into the blue sky, and of
the cushat dove that cooed to its mate in the leafy
dingle; the ring of the village chimes, and of
children's merry voices&mdash;came strongly to memory,
with the comforts of the land he never more might
tread&mdash;English home he never more might see.
</p>

<p>
Anon, strange monsters seemed to come out of
the starlit bosom of the glassy deep, to bob and
dance, to glare and jabber, with faces green, white,
lilac, and rose-coloured; and all as if to mock their
misery.
</p>

<p>
These, however, were only seaweed and foambells,
or floating blubber, to which the water gave
unusual size and phosphorescent light, while the
sufferers' giddy brains and weakened eyesight lent
them wild and fantastic forms.
</p>

<p>
Poor Tom Bartelot must have been quite
deranged; for more than once Morley heard him
singing what seemed to be a scrap of his old drinking
song, and his voice sunk into a childish quaver
at the couplet:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Oh, deign, ye kind powers, with this wish to comply,<br />
  May I always be drinking yet always be dry."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Then he suddenly changed his note to a kind of
hoarse wail, as he sang:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "King Death was a rare old fellow,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat where no sun could shine;<br />
  He lifted his hand so yellow,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pledged us in coal-black wine."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
He soon after became senseless, and hung, as if
asleep, drooping, alas! it might be, dead, in the
lashings that secured him to the taffrail.
</p>

<p>
Towards the morning of that terrible night,
Morley felt life ebbing within him, and, as it ebbed,
he had a last wild dream&mdash;wild, indeed; but too
delicious to be true.
</p>

<p>
A long, long time seemed to elapse, but another
day had dawned, and a ship&mdash;the false, cruel
Prussian barque of yesterday&mdash;had returned in
quest of them.  She lay to, a boat came off, he
heard the rattle of the fall tackles, and the splash of
the water.  They were, he thought, rescued; he
felt the lashing that bound his swollen limbs cut by
a seaman's jack-knife, and now kind faces and kind
hands were around him, and gentle voices were
murmuring in his ear.
</p>

<p>
Cool wine and grateful cordials seemed to be
poured between his parched lips, and then to be
suddenly withheld when he would have imbibed
more.
</p>

<p>
Oh, the madness of this tantalising and most
feverish dream, for Ethel Basset seemed to be
there!
</p>

<p>
Ethel, with her sweetly feminine and dear
affectionate face, was bending over him; her lips were
close to his, her kiss was on his cheek; but he
could neither respond nor speak, for Hawkshaw's
visage, pale and wrathful, was between them, with
knitted brows and glaring eyes, as he had seen it
last, when he fell beneath his hand at Acton Chine.
</p>

<p>
Then he seemed to sleep, to die; for he felt and
remembered no more.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br /><br />
CAPTAIN HAWKSHAW MAKES A DISCOVERY TO LEEWARD.
</h3>

<p>
On the night the <i>Princess</i> was lost, the <i>Hermione</i>
did not escape the same storm, which probably
traversed in a circle all the waters of the South
Atlantic.
</p>

<p>
It was no doubt the mere skirt of the tempest
which affected her, as the sky around was clear, and
the stars shone brilliantly.
</p>

<p>
Her jib was blown out of the bolt-rope and split
to ribbons, and she had her topsails close-reefed.
</p>

<p>
"Stow what remains of the jib," ordered Captain
Phillips; "into the netting with it&mdash;quick, men;
cheerily now, and up with the foretopmast-staysail."
</p>

<p>
As soon as this was done, he added:
</p>

<p>
"Go below, the watch, and take a nap if you can,
for it may blow great guns before morning."
</p>

<p>
"It is blowing three gales in one as it is," said
Mr. Quail.  "The water comes waist-high in the
lee-scuppers, and washes right chock aft to the
taffrail."
</p>

<p>
The <i>Hermione</i> was tearing through the sea upon
the wind, so she rolled little, but the wild waves
came pouring over her catheads and topgallant
forecastle, and over the weather bulwarks, swashing
and plashing their snowy spray far above the level
of her main-courser.
</p>

<p>
"Who is at the wheel?" asked the captain, who
was standing at the break of the quarter-deck.
</p>

<p>
"Badger, the long Yankee," replied Mr. Quail.
</p>

<p>
"All seems quiet among these rascals forward;
and they worked cheerily enough to-night."
</p>

<p>
"All quiet as yet, sir; but we don't know when
their little game may begin."
</p>

<p>
"If they should have changed their minds?"
suggested Phillips.
</p>

<p>
"No chance of that, sir," said Quail, shaking his
head.
</p>

<p>
"Or, if the doctor was mistaken?"
</p>

<p>
"Impossible, sir," said Quail, shaking his head
again&mdash;it was under a cloud of spray this time;
"and, even if he was so, we can't mistake the
disappearance of poor Manfredi after Sharkey's ugly
threats, and their mutinous spirit in general.  As
first mate, I have seen enough of it to last my time
at sea."
</p>

<p>
"I am prepared for the worst, at all events,"
responded Phillips, in the same low voice, as he
instinctively felt for the butt of the revolver pistol in
his breast-pocket, and ascended to the weather side
of the poop.
</p>

<p>
Veering round to the south-eastward, the wind
was soon dead against the ship, which laboured hard,
though running close-hauled, and, while beating to
windward, her head was many points away from her
proper course.
</p>

<p>
She was running fast through the water&mdash;ten
knots an hour at least&mdash;but was making great leeway.
The strain on the weather-rigging was great;
there every shroud, rope, and halyard were tight as
iron wire, while to leeward they were all blown
out in wavy bights and bends, especially at every
lurch.
</p>

<p>
There was never a lull in the fierce gale, and,
with every wave that burst against her bows, the
<i>Hermione</i> seemed to roll, or swerve, bodily off to
leeward.
</p>

<p>
On this night poor Mr. Basset was in great
mental misery, lest, amid the tempest, for to such
the gale nearly amounted, the crew should put their
nefarious designs in execution; but they had their
hands too full of necessary work to find time for
mischief then.
</p>

<p>
He twice ventured on deck, but, to the landsman's
eye, the aspect of that wild, stormy sea,
visible under a starry and cloudless sky, so appalled
him, that each time he returned to the cabin with
such visible signs of tremor or emotion, that Ethel,
who had found the impossibility of sleeping, and
had hastily thrown on her morning wrapper and
shawl, joined him, and sat caressingly by his side.
</p>

<p>
Pale, anxious, and lovely she looked in her
white-frilled dress; and now every sound on deck made
her father start with agitation.
</p>

<p>
"Is the gale increasing, papa?" she asked, for
the twentieth time.
</p>

<p>
"Undoubtedly it is&mdash;but the captain laughs at it,
and says his ship is strong and stout."
</p>

<p>
"How soundly dear Rose sleeps amid all this
hurly-burly."
</p>

<p>
"Bless the poor child&mdash;oh yes; but go to bed
beside her, darling, we have little fear to-night&mdash;for
the ship, at least."
</p>

<p>
"Have we aught to fear from the sea, papa?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Basset did not reply.
</p>

<p>
"You are silent, papa," resumed Ethel, scanning
his features keenly and affectionately, and patting
his cheek with her delicate hand; "then there is
some danger of which you do not tell me.  Oh,
papa, what is this you would conceal from me, who,
I know, am all the world to you?"
</p>

<p>
"You are, indeed, all the world to me now, Ethel&mdash;you
and Rose," replied the poor man, in a broken
voice, as his eyes filled, and his heart swelled with
uncontrollable anxiety and emotion; "but there,
dear, there, kiss me, and go to bed; don't waken
Rose&mdash;let the poor child sleep while she may."
</p>

<p>
And leading Ethel to her cabin, he pushed her
gently in, and closing the door, lay down on the
stern-locker to watch, but not to sleep.
</p>

<p>
This gale blew steadily for more than eight-and-forty
hours, during which the <i>Hermione</i> carried as
little canvas as possible, yet she made so much
leeway as to be blown far to the southward of the
Cape&mdash;how far was known only to Captain Phillips
and his two mates, Mr. Quail and Mr. Foster, as
they had tacitly agreed to keep the crew in total
ignorance of the ship's working or progress, hoping,
by doing so, to delay, if they could not ultimately
frustrate, any dark plans the intending mutineers
had formed.
</p>

<p>
During all this gale, which showed no signs of
abatement until the evening of the second day,
Ethel and her sister remained in the cabin with old
Nurse Folgate, who, with all her love for them, was
deploring the moment of weakness in which she
consented to leave the leafy seclusion of
Acton-Rennel, "to go forth a-voyaging round the world,
nobody knew to where."
</p>

<p>
Dr. Leslie Heriot found much to keep him below,
too; and thus, by day and by night, according to
the plan formed and already described, there was
always at least one armed man guarding them and
the cabin-door.
</p>

<p>
As for poor Mr. Basset, he never quitted the side
of his daughters now, until he saw them into their
little cabin for the night; and Ethel, who soon
perceived her father's new solicitude and affectionate
anxiety, was quite at a loss to understand what
caused it.
</p>

<p>
None knew how the lots had fallen, or whose cast
of the dice had been highest in the forecastle bunks
of the <i>Hermione</i>; but many of her crew, when they
came on deck, on the morning subsequent to the
amiable discussion so luckily overheard by
Dr. Heriot, bore unmistakable marks of a conflict, in
the shape of blackened eyes, swollen noses, and, in
more than one instance, a slash or stab from a
knife.
</p>

<p>
Whatever were the ultimate intentions of these
men, matters remained unchanged on board the
ship, the duty of which was carried on excellently
during the gale, for then every man did his duty
readily and cheerfully, either by force of habit, or
from the knowledge that to do so would save
themselves much trouble and probable danger.
</p>

<p>
No doubt they deemed it better to wait for an
opportunity after they were assured of being past
the Cape, when they would seize the ship, and, as
the doctor heard suggested, haul up for the
Mozambique Channel, a very unwise idea on their part, as,
in the narrow sea, they ran the imminent risk of
being overhauled by some man-of-war, homeward
bound, or transport full of troops&mdash;chances to be
avoided in the open Indian Ocean.
</p>

<p>
The tempest had blown them to the westward,
and also considerably to the southward of the Cape,
which lies in latitude 33.5.42 South, and longitude
18.23.15 East.  But the morning of the third day
came in clear and calm; there was a gentle breeze
from the eastward, and the ship was running
close-hauled, with her port-tacks on board, and
everything set upon her that would draw, even to
triangular skysails and niaintopgallant staysails, so
that her hull seemed a mere black speck under such
a cloud of white canvas.
</p>

<p>
And the glorious morning sun cast her shadow
far along the smooth ocean to the westward, as she
cleft its waters swiftly and steadily with her gallant
prow, from which a white female figure, representing
the <i>Hermione</i> of the classical age, the daughter of
Venus and wife of Cadmus, with Vulcan's golden
necklet round her slender throat, spread her graceful
arms above the foam.
</p>

<p>
The fourth and fifth days after the gale were
serene and lovely in the extreme.
</p>

<p>
There was scarcely need for the watch to rig the
head-pump for the last three mornings; washed by
the waves of the recent gale, the decks were white
as snow, and not even a shred or thread of spunyarn
could be seen about the wheels of the carronades,
the coamings of the hatches, or the mouths of the
scupper-holes.
</p>

<p>
Breakfast over, Rose and Ethel came on deck, and
Doctor Heriot hastened after them with cushions,
shawls, and wrappers, for the morning air in that
extreme southern latitude was cold, though clear and
bracing; even an iceberg was visible at the far and
blue horizon to the westward, an object to which
Heriot drew the attention of the sisters, and promptly
arranged for them his telescope; but the fair voyagers
had become quite used to such things, so Ethel
betook herself to a novel, and Rose began a piece of
crochet (which seemed like the web of Penelope) in
expectation that her lover would sit by and converse
with her.
</p>

<p>
Both seemed paler than usual, in consequence of
the few days' confinement below.  Their father was
anxious still, and the poor man continued to linger
about them, to hover near them, and instinctively
his trembling hand felt for the loaded revolver he
carried in secret, if one of the crew came near his
daughters, and his heart beat quicker if even one
glanced to them, for in him he suspected the winner
by the dice-box of the two abhorred Barradas.
</p>

<p>
Hawkshaw, whom the young doctor's steady
attentions to the sisters galled and fretted, was up in
the fore-rigging, somewhere, looking out for a sail,
as no one on board longed for the appearance of a
ship of war more than he did; so he kept one eye
on the horizon, and another on the quarter-deck,
where Ethel and Rose were seated, chatting and
laughing.
</p>

<p>
Heriot had carefully examined, capped, and charged
anew his revolver, and placed it in his breast-pocket
before he joined them, so the crew very little
suspected how completely all their superiors were
forewarned and forearmed.
</p>

<p>
The two girls looked, if possible, lovelier than ever
on this, as it will prove in the sequel, eventful
morning, by a species of delicate pallor induced by the
close atmosphere of the cabin; and as young Heriot
gazed into their clear, full, earnest eyes, a fierce,
high spirit swelled up in his heart, and he almost
rejoiced that the terrible circumstances in which they
were placed, sailing as it were with a volcano on
board, would give him an opportunity of showing
how dearly he loved Rose Basset, how willing
he was to dare, alas! it might be to die for her!
</p>

<p>
Not that he would gain much by the last move, as
reflection showed, and die he might, perhaps, by the
hands of some of those ruffians, before she could be
succoured and protected, and then there was acute
agony in the contemplation of what she might endure
when he could neither see nor avenge it.
</p>

<p>
"Look, Ethel dear," Rose suddenly exclaimed
with girlish delight, "there is a great swan asleep
on the water."
</p>

<p>
"A swan here?" queried Ethel.
</p>

<p>
"It is an albatross," said the doctor, smiling,
"and sleeping sound enough, certainly.  I could
almost toss a biscuit on his back."
</p>

<p>
There, not twelve yards distant from the ship's
side, on the smooth surface of the sea, was a great
albatross, with plumage white as snow&mdash;a bird whose
pinions may have measured twelve feet from tip to
tip&mdash;fast asleep, and floating with his huge head
under his wing.
</p>

<p>
Slowly he was upheaved upon each huge glassy
swell, and slowly he sank down into the glassy vale
between them, sleeping, as Ethel said, just as she
had seen the swans on Acton Mere at home, and
now this lonely bird was perhaps 300 miles from
land.
</p>

<p>
When first descried he was upon the weather-bow,
and now he was upon the lee quarter, so rapidly the
ship left far astern this great bird of the "Ancient
Mariner," enjoying his nap, all undisturbed, upon
the morning sea.
</p>

<p>
Hawkshaw, who was pretty far up the fore-rigging,
now drew the attention of some of the crew, who
were at work upon the foreyard, greasing the sling
thereof, reeving new bunt-lines to the foot of the
foretopsail, &amp;c., to a small dark object that was
floating on the water at a great distance, and the
discussion that ensued about it soon caught the
attention of the anxious and active Mr. Quail, who
was standing at the break of the quarter-deck, for
the <i>Hermione</i> had a species of half poop, so he
descended into the waist and hailed the talkers.
</p>

<p>
"Fore-top there!"
</p>

<p>
"Aye, aye, sir," replied Bill Badger and Zuares
Barradas.
</p>

<p>
"Do you see anything, that you keep such a
bright look-out to leeward, eh?'
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir; there is something in sight," replied
Zuares.
</p>

<p>
"Something; well, what is it?"
</p>

<p>
"The head o' the great sea-sarpent, I rayther
reckons it to be," replied Bill Badger, impudently;
"I sees his row o' grinders standing up above the
water."
</p>

<p>
"Grinders, you Yankee swab," responded Mr. Quail
(under his breath, however, for the fid-maul
and a couple of iron marlinespikes were lying in the
foretop, and one of these might fall out of it, by
accident); "what you call grinders are the timber-heads
of a piece of wreck&mdash;if not, I am as green as
a cabbage!  A piece of wreck in sight to leeward,
sir," he reported down the skylight to Captain
Phillips, who came promptly on deck, telescope in
hand.
</p>

<p>
"Whereabouts, Mr. Quail?"
</p>

<p>
"There, sir; you can see it now under the leach
of the forecourse, when the ship rises&mdash;can you
make it out?'
</p>

<p>
"Wreck it is, Quail; the taffrail and sternpost of
a vessel.  Ease her off a bit, Pedro; edge down
towards it," said the captain to the elder Barradas,
whose strong hands grasped the handsome, brass-mounted
wheel of the <i>Hermione</i>; "we are raising
it fast."
</p>

<p>
"If there ain't men a-clinging to it, I'm a
Dutchman!" shouted Badger, from the foretop.
</p>

<p>
"The fellow is right," said Phillips, politely
passing his glass to Mr. Basset; "human figures
are visible on it.  Ready the lee quarter boat,
there&mdash;clear the fall tackles; keep her on a little
just as she is, Mr. Quail, and then back with the
mainyard."
</p>

<p>
All the crew crowded to the leeside of the deck
now, and their entire attention was riveted on the
piece of drifting wreck which lay like a log in the
water; but towards which they were rapidly bearing
down.
</p>

<p>
Ere long, four men could be distinctly seen upon
it, but whether alive or dead none could say with
certainty, though all surmised the latter, as they
made neither sign nor hail, but remained still, mute,
and passive as the timber-heads to which they were
lashed, and which rose and fell, slowly and sullenly,
amid the sunny ripples of that calm morning sea.
</p>

<p><a id="chap12"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br /><br />
DR. HERIOT'S PATIENTS.
</h3>

<p>
Filled with the interest roused by this new episode,
the crew, for a time, forgot everything in their
desire to know what ship this had been, where she
hailed from, to relieve the sufferers, and to learn all
they had undergone; for, even in his worst moods,
Jack is always ready for anything, and the more of
novelty it contains, the better for him.
</p>

<p>
The four drooping figures could be distinctly
discerned now, with their heads bare, their faces
blanched and pale.  Ethel and Rose were full of
commiseration; already their gentle eyes were
swimming in sympathetic tears.  The former kept
by the side of her father, and the latter, in her
excitement, leant more heavily than usual, perhaps,
on the arm of Dr. Heriot; and even old Nance
Folgate had come out of her berth, and muttering
"Lor' a mussy me!" from time to time, clung with
cat-like tenacity to the nettings on the lee-quarter,
to see the castaways, whom, she had no doubt, had
been devouring each other from time to time, till
only four were left now.
</p>

<p>
"Back with the mainyard," shouted the captain;
"to the braces, men; let go and haul!"
</p>

<p>
The lee-braces were cast off the belaying-pins;
the weather hauled in, and the yard was slued
round till the sail was laid flat to the mast; and
now the great ship, which had been edged down
towards the piece of wreck, as she lay to, rose and
fell with slow, but regular and impatient heaves, on
the swelling ridges of the sea, while, with a quick
revolution of the double-sheaved blocks, the
fall-tackle fell and the quarter-boat vanished from its
davits with a splash into the sea alongside.
</p>

<p>
She was speedily manned: Mr. Foster, the
second mate, took the tiller; Bill Badger, the
Yankee; Joe, the steward; Quaco, the black
Virginian, and Dr. Heriot (with Rose's entreaties to
take care of himself, ringing in his ears), shipped
their oars in the rowlocks, and she was shoved
off.
</p>

<p>
"Happy go lucky! here's summut new, at all
events," said Bill Badger, as he made the tough
blade of the stroke-oar bend like a willow wand;
for after a long, dull voyage like that of the
<i>Hermione</i>, varied only by adverse winds and the
loss of a mast at the Canaries&mdash;a voyage in which a
few restless and roving spirits are shut up for many
weeks in the small compass of a ship&mdash;anything
that may serve to relieve or vary the tedium and
monotony of the life they lead is welcome; hence, a
drifting wreck, with its contingent stories, mysteries,
and the surmises it may occasion, is, perhaps, the
most welcome, though least lively adventure they
could meet with.
</p>

<p>
The proceedings of the boat's crew were watched
with deep interest by those who lined the ship's
side, about 500 yards off.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Foster pulled round the stern of the wreck,
and was seen to stoop with his face close to the
water, as if he was endeavouring to read (which was
the case) the vessel's name, then sunk some feet
below the surface, as the wreck was half submerged.
</p>

<p>
Then he sheered the boat alongside, and by the
painter it was made fast to a timber-head; but
almost immediately after, for fear of accidents, this
was cast off, and she was simply held on by the
boat-hook.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Foster, Dr. Heriot, and another stepped
along the piece of quarter-deck, and were seen to
be examining the four men, whom they relieved
from their wet lashings by simply cutting these
through with a slash of Quaco's jack-knife.
</p>

<p>
"Evidently, the poor fellows are not dead," said
Captain Phillips, joyfully, as he clapped his fat
hands together.
</p>

<p>
"How do you know, dear sir?" asked Ethel;
"ah, the poor men, I do not see them move!"
</p>

<p>
"They are putting them into the boat to bring
them aboard, Miss Basset.  If they had been dead,
there would have been little use in doing that."
</p>

<p>
"What would you have done in that case,
captain?" asked Mr. Basset.
</p>

<p>
"Sunk each of 'em simply, with a round shot at
his heels, as we did the poor fellow whom we found
floating with the life-buoy.  Mr. Quail, get some
brandy and wine out of the cabin locker&mdash;some
water, please, too."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, let me assist you, sir," exclaimed Ethel.
</p>

<p>
"And me&mdash;me too," added Rose, with enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
"Stop, ladies, you'll only lose your footing and
get a tumble, perhaps, the ship is pitching so;
better stay where you are, and hold on by the side
netting."
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" said Captain Phillips, suddenly;
"silence on deck&mdash;silence fore and aft, for
Dr. Heriot is hailing the ship, and waving his
cap."
</p>

<p>
"What is it that he is saying?" asked several,
as the doctor's clear voice came distinctly over the
water.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Phillips," they heard him cry, "please
to request the ladies to leave the deck."
</p>

<p>
"That is plain enough, miss," said Mr. Quail,
touching his cap to Ethel.
</p>

<p>
"Why&mdash;for what must we go?" said Rose, pouting.
</p>

<p>
"You must permit me to lead you below, ladies,"
said the captain; "depend upon it, the doctor knows
best.  There is something there he does not wish
you to see."
</p>

<p>
So Ethel, Rose, and the old nurse, to the intense
mortification of the latter, left the deck, and retired
to the cabin to wait the event.
</p>

<p>
The truth was that the worthy young doctor had
found the four sufferers on the wreck, though not
dead, as he fully ascertained on feeling their pulses,
in such a frightful state of prostration and delirium,
that he deemed it better Ethel and Rose should be
spared the shock of their first appearance, and should
not witness the conveyance of them up the ship's side.
</p>

<p>
"They are all in the boat now, and now she is
shoved off.  Give way, my boys&mdash;give way!"
shouted the captain, whose kind, ruddy English
face flushed with eagerness.  "Lay out on your oars
and pull with a will, for a glass of grog awaits you
all."
</p>

<p>
To do them justice, the men in the boat needed
no incentive; to the whole length of their arms
they bent to their oars, and the boat came sheering
alongside in a twinkling.
</p>

<p>
"In larboard oars, out fenders," said Mr. Foster,
as he relinquished the tiller.
</p>

<p>
"Into the main-chains there, some of you, and
bear a hand to get the poor fellows on board," said
Captain Phillips, jumping down the short ladder at
the break of the quarter-deck, just as four thin and
wasted figures&mdash;their tattered clothes sodden and
saturated by salt water, their matted hair encrusted
with salt&mdash;were handed like children up the side,
passed over the bulwark, and laid on the deck near
the long-boat.
</p>

<p>
"Poor fellows, poor fellows!  God help them,"
said Phillips, commiseratingly, as they seemed quite
insensible.  Their teeth were clenched, but their lips
were far apart, cracked, parched, and, in some
instances, bleeding.  They breathed irregularly, and
twitched their fingers convulsively.
</p>

<p>
"They must be your peculiar care for a time,
doctor," said Mr. Basset, as Heriot flung his coat on
the deck, and while rolling up his shirt-sleeves,
rushed below to his medicine-chest.
</p>

<p>
"Boy, Joe&mdash;steward, bring wine and brandy
here!  Carpenter, get four comfortable hammocks
slung in the 'tween decks; and you, Quaco, my
darkey, get us plenty of hot water from the galley,"
cried Phillips.
</p>

<p>
"Yaas, sar," replied the sable Virginian, as he
hastened forward with a bucket.
</p>

<p>
Every one bustled about, and even Sharkey, the
sulkiest villain of that ill-assorted crew, made
himself useful in some way, or fancied that he did so.
</p>

<p>
"These men are evidently British seamen," said
the captain, as the doctor stooped over each, and
raising his head, poured weak brandy-and-water,
with some medicament therein, down his throat.
"How thirstily they drink!  One opens his eyes.
All right, my friend, you'll soon come to," added
the kind skipper, as he patted Morrison on the
shoulder.  "Now then," said he, "Mr. Quail, get
the quarter-boat hoisted in, and fill the mainyard.
Trim the ship to her course."
</p>

<p>
"Very good, sir."
</p>

<p>
It was soon done, and the <i>Hermione</i>, as she began
again to walk through the water, soon left the piece
of wreck astern.
</p>

<p>
"Did you make out the name of that unfortunate
craft, Mr. Foster?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir; but with difficulty."
</p>

<p>
"And what was it?"
</p>

<p>
Our readers, of course, anticipate the reply.
</p>

<p>
"The <i>Princess</i>, of London&mdash;ship rig evidently,
from the side chains, the double row of dead eyes,
and the gearing of the mizzenmast."
</p>

<p>
"All right.  Now bring up the ship's log."
</p>

<p>
The four patients were taken below.  A little
food, such as might be made for children, arrowroot
with, sherry, and so forth, was given to them, and
greedily they devoured it.  They were then
stripped, sponged with warm fresh water, and
lifted each into a comfortable hammock, the active
young doctor, Mr. Foster, the captain and steward,
working for them like servants and nurses with
hearty good-will.
</p>

<p>
Gentle cordials were then administered, and soon
after Heriot appeared in the cabin with a bright and
smiling face, wearing the happy expression of one
who, in doing a good action, has done his best, to
report that they had fallen into a sound sleep, were
all doing well, and would, he hoped, soon be free
from danger.
</p>

<p>
"It was too bad of you to send us below like
children," said Rose.
</p>

<p>
"And you think they will recover, doctor?"
asked Ethel, interrupting some playful apology of
Heriot's.
</p>

<p>
"Recover?  Oh yes, and perhaps be with us
soon at table, too; so poor Manfredi's seat may
thus be filled.  Like Banquo's, it has long been
empty."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Leslie, how can you jest thus?" whispered
Rose.
</p>

<p>
"I don't jest, dearest," replied the doctor,
deprecatingly.  "I liked poor Adrian Manfredi too well
to associate his idea now with a jest," he added,
gravely, as he thought of that night in the
forecastle bunks, of the revelations he had heard, and
the peril that was yet unaverted.
</p>

<p>
"Have the poor men said anything?" asked Ethel.
</p>

<p>
"Not much, Miss Basset, beyond a few
indistinct and delirious mutterings."
</p>

<p>
"Could you gather who they were?"
</p>

<p>
"No; but they all seem to be seamen, save one."
</p>

<p>
"One?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
(How little could she dream who <i>this one was</i>!)
</p>

<p>
"And you are able to distinguish," she resumed.
</p>

<p>
"At once&mdash;by their hands and general appearance."
</p>

<p>
"And this one, who is not a seaman?"
</p>

<p>
"Is a pale, and thin&mdash;but then he has been
starved&mdash;and gentleman-like young man.  Though
half dead with privation, he made a whispered
apology for the trouble he gave us."
</p>

<p>
"Poor fellow!" said Ethel, whose eyes glistened.
</p>

<p>
"Where was their vessel from?&mdash;how was she
lost?&mdash;and where was she lost?" asked Rose.
</p>

<p>
"They are past telling all this now," said the
doctor, smiling, and patting Rose's hand; "by
to-morrow evening, perhaps, we shall learn all."
</p>

<p>
"I do long so to hear their story&mdash;how terrible it
must be&mdash;quite a nautical romance; and then, the
other poor men of their ship, who have been
drowned!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Rose," said Ethel, glancing at the captain
and mate, who were each making an entry in his
log or journal, "this incident will fill up an entire
page of your diary."
</p>

<p>
"How&mdash;why?" asked Rose, reddening very perceptibly.
</p>

<p>
"For Lucy Page's perusal," said Ethel, with a
smile that had a little mischief, or waggery, in it.
</p>

<p>
Rose grew redder, for her diary or journal of the
voyage, which she had begun to keep (from the day
she left Laurel Lodge), for the special perusal of her
friend and gossip, Lucy Page, had proved rather a
bore, and had been completely relinquished, as she
could not consistently omit, and yet shrank from
recording, memoranda of a certain little interview
with the doctor, being naturally restrained
therefrom by a certain awkwardness, if the eye of Jack
Page, now almost a myth to her, as he has been,
perhaps, to the reader, should peruse them also.
</p>

<p>
So Rose had ceased altogether to continue that
interesting volume, which, we may presume, terminated
abruptly on that night recorded in a previous
chapter, when she and the doctor took a turn on
deck to view the stars.
</p>

<p>
At this moment Cramply Hawkshaw entered the
cabin with an expression of face so scared, so
altered, and so unmistakably wretched, that Ethel
surveyed him with surprise; and then, with some
commiseration, she kindly inquired if he was ill?
</p>

<p>
He complained of giddiness, and abruptly
hastened on deck.
</p>

<p>
In fact, our ex-Texan officer had just come from
between decks, where he had been visiting the
doctor's patients.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><br />
CAPTAIN HAWKSHAW'S TROUBLES INCREASE.
</h3>

<p>
Inspired by some emotion beyond curiosity&mdash;a feeling
which it would be alike impossible to define or
describe, Hawkshaw had gone between decks to
look at the rescued men.
</p>

<p>
A man had been left to watch them.  He was
Bolter, the Canadian, to whom Dr. Heriot had given
strict injunctions that the sleepers were not to be
disturbed to gratify the mere curiosity of the crew;
and he growled out a few words by way of warning
to Hawkshaw, who, assuming a jaunty air, said:
</p>

<p>
"Now, my amphibious biped, how are your
patients?"
</p>

<p>
"None of your names, mister," replied the
Canadian, knitting his brows.
</p>

<p>
"You mistake me, my good fellow; I simply
wished to know how our new friends are."
</p>

<p>
"Judge for yourself&mdash;blow'd if I know," was the
sulky rejoinder, as Bolter replaced a tremendous
expectoration (which he shot fairly over Hawkshaw's
shoulder and out at the lee port) by a huge
quid; "but they seemed all goin' forren&mdash;out'ard
bound, till the doctor hove 'em up fresh."
</p>

<p>
Each was in his hammock sleeping soundly, in
that deep, drowsy torpor which enables even "the
famished to escape from the pangs of hunger, and
those who are perishing of thirst to escape for a
time from the agony of the parched throat"&mdash;the
sleep that covereth a man all over like a mantle, as
honest Sancho Panza said, when, in the fulness of
his heart, he blessed the great inventor thereof.
</p>

<p>
On tiptoe Hawkshaw passed from sleeper to sleeper.
</p>

<p>
One seemed a brawny and weather-beaten seaman,
with grizzled locks, that were fast becoming
gray; his bare and muscular chest was tattooed
blue with gunpowder.  This was our old friend
Noah Gawthrop.
</p>

<p>
The second he looked at was somewhat hard-featured,
with a high forehead, dark, full eyebrows,
a well-shaped nose, and one of those prominent
chins which bespeak firmness, decision of character,
and indomitable perseverance.  He was the Scotch
mate, Bill Morrison.
</p>

<p>
The next was a pale, wan lad, whose handsome
but attenuated features&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Gad's fury!" burst from the lips of Hawkshaw,
as the sudden recognition of those features struck a
terror into his soul.  "He here! he!  Can it be
possible?"
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, shipmate, what's the row?" said Bolter,
looking up from a sea-chest, on which he was
lolling, with his hands in his pockets; "Vast and
belay this gab o' yours, or you'll waken 'em up,
which is clear ag'in the doctor's orders."
</p>

<p>
"A mosquito stung me," said Hawkshaw, with a
confusion which Bolter's perceptions were not fine
enough to discover.
</p>

<p>
"A miskitty in these latitudes!" he exclaimed,
mockingly.  "I'm not so jolly green a hand as to
believe that; but be off on deck, and leave me to
keep my watch 'athout you.  I may say this, though
the ship is yet trimmed by the starn," added the
fellow, with an insolent grimace, for like the rest
of the crew, whom the Barradas influenced, he had
a peculiar aversion for Hawkshaw.
</p>

<p>
The latter had now shrunk back, scarcely breathing,
after assuring himself that the pale sleeper was
indeed Morley Ashton; and then flashed upon his
mind the keen and savage idea of getting him again
removed from his path&mdash;by strangling him in his
sleep, by putting poison in his food&mdash;and thus to
send him out of the world ere his eyes again fully
opened on it, and ere he, Hawkshaw, could be
destroyed by the story he had to tell&mdash;by the great
crime he had to reveal.
</p>

<p>
From the cabin, as we have told, he went on
deck, and, desirous of avoiding all, of seeking that
solitude so impossible to find on board ship, he
ascended into the fore-rigging, and sat there, amid a
whirl, a chaos of thought, endeavouring to consider
his prospects and position now!
</p>

<p>
Could he have been mistaken?
</p>

<p>
Impossible!  The likeness had been too deeply
impressed upon his memory since that awful night
at Acton Chine; so he needed not to go between
decks again, and, moreover, he dared not, lest
Morley should awake and recognise him.
</p>

<p>
"How came he to escape death at the Chine?
How to be sailing on the sea, and hereabout too?"
thought Hawkshaw.  "Oh, strange, and most
accursed fatality!  But for me, perhaps, we might
have passed that piece of wreck&mdash;passed it unseen
by all on board; but Fate is retributive; I was the
first to descry, the first to be anxious to visit it."
</p>

<p>
For a moment, but a moment only, there came
into his soul a gleam of joy, with the conviction
that he was not, as he had so long remorsefully
considered himself, the destroyer of a fellow-creature.
</p>

<p>
His victim&mdash;Heaven alone knew how!&mdash;had escaped,
and was here alive and safe on board the
<i>Hermione</i>.  The ever-present idea of crime, with the
word that had seemed ever before his eyes, on his
lips, and in his heart&mdash;that shone in his dreams like
those letters of flame that flashed on the vision of
Belshazzar, could be a terror to him no longer.
</p>

<p>
The proverbs, that "Murder will out;" that
"God's retribution will fall upon a murderer;" the
law, that "Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man
shall his blood be shed," would haunt him no
more,&mdash;for this crime at least.
</p>

<p>
Such were his ideas for a moment; but the next,
cold, selfish fear resumed its sway, and reason
showed him that he was yet an assassin by intent&mdash;one
whom his intended victim would expose, crush,
and destroy, <i>if</i>&mdash;what?&mdash;he was not anticipated,
crushed and destroyed <i>first</i>.
</p>

<p>
To Hawkshaw, this waif from the ocean was
worse by a thousand degrees than his <i>rencontre</i> with
the two Barradas.
</p>

<p>
To avoid the accusations, the shame and
contumely that Morley Ashton could heap upon him,
by the exposure of his falsehood, cruelty, and
hypocrisy, he would, happily, now have relinquished
even Ethel Basset, and all he had hoped from her
father's patronage in the Isle of France.  He would
gladly have fled; but whither could he fly&mdash;how,
when, where?&mdash;encompassed as he was by the sea?
Save in its depth, there was no escape from this
accursed ship, as there was no eluding his own
conscience, in this floating prison, the <i>Hermione</i>&mdash;how
he loathed the name!&mdash;with her crew of foul
and treacherous mutineers.
</p>

<p>
He had one hope left.  Morley might die on
getting food.  He seemed so weak when brought on
board, that the powers of digestion might be past,
so that death might ensue from mere inanition.
</p>

<p>
But then his three companions would probably
know his story, and were certain, if they survived,
to reveal all Hawkshaw's guilt.
</p>

<p>
In the bitterness of his soul, he contemplated
suicide, by slipping quietly overboard before the
fatal recognition and discovery took place; but then
came the fierce thought&mdash;if one of us is to perish,
why should not he? and what time so fitting as now,
when he is weak&mdash;almost dying?  And thus, in his
blind desperation, some of his old Mexican instincts
or propensities grew strong within him, and he
conceived the fiendish idea of strangling, or otherwise
destroying, the half-dead lad in the night.
</p>

<p>
If marks of violence were found upon him,
Hawkshaw knew there were so many "black sheep"
in the forecastle, that one of them would readily be
blamed for the crime.
</p>

<p>
A fierce eagerness to put himself in a safe position,
to prevent the discovery that would blight him for
ever, now possessed his whole soul, and, nerving it
for the deadly task he had to do, made him long for
the darkness and silence of night, when he resolved
to make the attempt.
</p>

<p>
In this pleasant mood of mind, he heard the cabin
bell rung by Joe the steward, announcing dinner,
and descending reluctantly from his perch in the
fore-rigging, he went aft and took his seat between
Ethel and Dr. Heriot, who were conversing gaily,
while he had all the misery of having to veil over
the secret serpent that gnawed at his heart, by an
outward air of ease, security, and pleasantry, which,
however, was nearly put to flight by Captain Phillips
asking if he had seen the devil in the foretop, he
looked so very white about the gills.
</p>

<p>
One portion of the conversation, maintained
amid the clinking of glasses and plates, and the
difficulty of balancing wine-glasses nicely when the
ship rolled, was by no means calculated to restore
his equanimity.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Basset," said the young doctor, blandly,
"I hope you will come with me, and visit those poor
fellows?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, with pleasure.  Rose and papa will come too."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it will cheer them a bit to see your dear,
kind, pretty faces," said Captain Phillips, bowing to
each sister, ere he drained his glass of sherry.
</p>

<p>
"You will quite spoil my girls by flattering them,"
said Mr. Basset, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"Our good captain is too honest for flattery,"
resumed Dr. Heriot; "but, Miss Basset, there is
one fellow there who interests me much, though
why I cannot say.  Please to look at him well when
you see him.  There is something very remarkable
about him."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, how, pray?"
</p>

<p>
"I judge by his bearing, and the general
expression of his face.  As a clever American writer
says, of a similar impression, 'His is one of those
cases which are more numerous than supposed by
those who have never lived anywhere but in their
own homes, and have never walked but in one line
from their cradles to their graves.  We must leave
our straight paths for the by-ways and low places
of life, if we would learn truths by strong contrasts,
and in hovels, in forecastles, and among our own
outcasts in foreign lands, see what has been brought
upon our fellow-creatures by accident, hardship, or
vice.'
</p>

<p>
"Vice!" repeated Hawkshaw, with a nervous
start, and in dread lest Morley had already
discovered himself.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, do not misunderstand me.  I merely
completed the quotation.  Heaven forbid, Mr. Hawkshaw,
that I should attribute vice to one so gentle as
my poor patient; but to-morrow, or at latest, next
day, you shall see them, ladies, and I shall have
much pleasure in being your guide between decks."
</p>

<p>
Hawkshaw felt as if the doctor was dictating his
sentence of degradation and death; but he strove
to preserve an unmoved countenance, and to affect
a pleasant demeanour.
</p>

<p>
Then he had to do the honours of the table to
Ethel Basset, while his food seemed to choke him,
with the agreeable consciousness that he whom she
still loved, and for whom she still sorrowed, Morley
Ashton, was asleep quietly in his hammock, on the
other side of the after-bulkhead, and scarcely three
feet distant from her chair.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap14"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><br />
HAWKSHAW TURNS NURSE.
</h3>

<p>
For that night all went well on board, as Dr. Heriot
kept his watch between decks lest he should be
wanted, and the next morning he reported a great
improvement in his four patients, whom food, wine,
and sleep were restoring so fast that he hoped by
evening, perhaps, to learn their names, whence they
came, and all about them.
</p>

<p>
Hawkshaw started on hearing this.  That all the
four had been found dead in their hammocks would
have been to him the more welcome tidings.
</p>

<p>
"Aye, doctor, be sure about their names, as we
must have them inserted in the log," said Captain
Phillips.  "Miss Basset, may we trouble you to
pour out some tea for the poor fellows?"
</p>

<p>
Younger than his companions, Morley was the
first to recover complete consciousness for a time
on this morning.  Naturally strong, lithe, and active,
he had been wont, when ashore, to ride, shoot and fish,
to be a first-rate bowler at cricket, a good hand with
foils, gloves, single-stick, and to indulge in all hardy
sports; hence his vigorous frame was less shaken
than those of Bartelot, Morrison, and Noah, who
were his seniors in age.
</p>

<p>
The 'tween decks of the <i>Hermione</i> was a clear
and airy place.  Through a half-open port to
leeward he could see the bright green sea running
past in the morning sunshine; a pleasant breeze
came down the half-grating of the open hatchway,
and as the ship was running on a wind, the
hammocks hung steadily.
</p>

<p>
The ship's bell clanged on deck; he heard a
hoarse voice calling the watch, and gradually the
dream-like events of the past day unfolded
themselves with some coherence, and with a sigh of joy,
an unuttered prayer of gratitude, he closed his
eyes again, with the delicious conviction of being
safe and in kind hands.
</p>

<p>
Ere long Boy Joe came from the cabin with
warm tea and soaked biscuits for them.
</p>

<p>
How little did Morley know whose hands had
poured it into the cups!  And now, refreshed, and
aware of each other's presence, all swinging side
by side in their hammocks, Bartelot and Morrison
began to converse with him.
</p>

<p>
This roused old Noah, who had dozed off to sleep
again; so he began to mutter hoarsely in a dream:
</p>

<p>
"All starbowlines ahoy; come, tumble up the
larboard watch."
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter, Noah?" asked Bartelot.
</p>

<p>
"It is that 'ere smatchet of a marine drummer,"
replied Gawthrop, looking up vacantly.
</p>

<p>
"He is dreaming of the old <i>Aurora</i>, of fifty
guns," said Morrison, in a weak voice, quite unlike
his own.  "Hollo, Noah, old fellow; you've not
unroved your life-lines yet, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"No, mate, thank Heaven," he replied, in something
of the same childish treble; "nor you.  And
you shall see the Black Dog of Belhelvie yet, as I
hopes one of these blessed days to see Dungeonness
Light and the buoy at the Nore."
</p>

<p>
"Here, shipmate, drink this, and talk after," said
Joe, the steward, as he held another cup of warm
tea (in which a whipped egg was substituted for
milk) to the lips of Noah, who drained it at a
draught, and then looked less wild and more awake.
</p>

<p>
"Go ahead, old boy," said Joe, a curly-headed,
good-humoured-looking English lad, as he tucked
the blanket about Noah's shoulders; "it is tea for
dunnage, and soft biscuits for ballast just now.
By-and-by, it will be grog and old horse for cargo, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"It's the 'tween decks that did it," muttered
Noah.  "I thought I was aboard the old <i>Haurora</i>
in the Black Sea, with the boatswain ahead in the
dingy, seeing all the yards squared by the lifts and
braces."
</p>

<p>
Bartelot sank into slumber again, but Morley
began to be more lively and awake, and proceeded
to compare with Morrison the notes and incidents
of yesterday, and how they came to be rescued.
Their voices sounded strangely to themselves and to
each other, as at times they sank into husky
whispers.
</p>

<p>
Morrison had seen much of the world.  In the
words of his countryman, a poor sailor too (Falconer,
the doomed author of the "Shipwreck"), he had
been in every climate under the sun.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Where polar skies congeal the eternal snow,<br />
  Or equinoctial suns for ever glow.<br />
  Smote by the freezing or the scorching blast,<br />
  'A ship-boy on the high and giddy mast,'<br />
  From, regions where Peruvian billows roar<br />
  To the bleak coasts of savage Labrador.<br />
  From where Damascus, pride of Asian plains,<br />
  Stoops her proud neck beneath tyrannic chains,<br />
  To where the Isthmus, laved by adverse tides,<br />
  Atlantic and Pacific seas divides.<br />
  But while he measured o'er the painful race,<br />
  In fortune's wild, illimitable chase,<br />
  Adversity, companion of his way,<br />
  Still o'er the victim hung with iron sway."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Morrison was deeply thankful to Providence for
his rescue; and on the first night of their being
saved, Morley could remember, through his dreams,
hearing the poor fellow praying very devoutly in his
hammock, and in his own national dialect, which
grew all the broader and more Doric as he
communed with God and himself.
</p>

<p>
On the afternoon of the day, so pregnant with
events of importance to him personally, Cramply
Hawkshaw felt himself impelled, on various
pretences, to keep aloof from those who shared the
cabin with him; for he was in momentary dread
that Dr. Heriot, to whom the name of Morley
Ashton had been rendered quite familiar by the
confidences of Rose Basset, would enter, and startle
all by announcing who was one of the four men
rescued from the wreck.
</p>

<p>
The better to achieve his dastardly project, he
volunteered to attend them on this night between
decks; and his offer, though it excited some surprise,
was at once accepted by Dr. Heriot, who gave
him several directions as to the small quantities of
food and diluted wine they were to receive, if they
required nourishment.
</p>

<p>
So Hawkshaw drank deeply, mixing brandy and
sherry, to nerve himself for the dark purpose he
had conceived; and, to conceal his pallor, his
restlessness and wretchedness, he secluded himself
in his own berth, and strove to sleep; but there
was no sleep for him.
</p>

<p>
Thoughts maddened him, and he muttered to himself
inaudibly, while, with a hot and trembling hand,
he wiped the bead-drops from his aching brow.
</p>

<p>
"Why should I waver or shrink now?" he asked
himself&mdash;not aloud, for fear of being overheard;
"what may I not dare, who have dared everything,
I who have risked all?  For the past I have no
compunction now.  Another might have done all
those things as well as I, for I did not create myself,
neither did I scheme out my own accursed destiny.
Is there a demon within me, or is there one
presiding over me&mdash;some fiend, some angel of darkness,
whom I cannot see, but to whose whispers I am
compelled to listen?  Why does this wretched boy
cross my path again?  Why does the sea&mdash;why
does the grave&mdash;give up its dead, as if to haunt, to
tempt, to goad me into crime on one hand, if I
would not lose name, honour, consideration, respect,
and, it may be, Ethel and affluence, on the other?
I had thought to be good, and loyal, and true for
her sake, even though she loves me not; but all in
vain.  Ethel to marry me?  Oh, that would be like
a white moss-rose entwined with the deadly hemlock!
Had Heaven not impelled or abandoned me, and
had Hell not allured and prompted me, perhaps I
had not been the creature I find myself to-night.
<i>Caramba!</i> it is a game of desperation between this
Ashton and me.  The ball is yet at my foot, and shall
I not strike it?  Yes, and with a vengeance, too!"
</p>

<p>
Watch after watch was called; the half-hourly
bells of the ship seemed to be rung every five
minutes, instead of every thirty.
</p>

<p>
The night, solemn and starry, approached more
swiftly than he could have wished; and yet he
longed that the fatal time was past&mdash;that the
terrible deed he had to do was done.
</p>

<p>
Thus he lay on his bed, almost perspiring with
mental agony and with criminal sophistry, gradually
nursing himself into the conviction that the first law
of nature&mdash;self-protection and self-preservation&mdash;rendered
that deed imperative, needful, and requisite.
</p>

<p>
He almost consoled himself by the idea that there
was but half a life to crush out; for was not Morley
nearly half dead already?
</p>

<p>
Darkness had set in, before he missed daylight,
so completely had his mind and thoughts been
abstracted and turned inward; thus he received a
species of electric shock, when the curtain of his
berth was withdrawn by Heriot, who said:
</p>

<p>
"Now, then, Mr. Hawkshaw&mdash;come, tumble up,
old fellow&mdash;eight bells have struck; it is twelve
o'clock, and you have not been 'tween decks yet to
look after these men."
</p>

<p>
"Twelve&mdash;twelve o'clock is it?" he stammered,
with confusion, as he leaped out.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, to a minute; the ladies and all have supped
and turned in.  By Jove! you've had a long spell
in your berth.  Can you make your way forward alone?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes," replied Hawkshaw, who reeled like a
tipsy man, for the ship was now running before the
wind, so she rolled till her lower studdingsail-booms
nearly touched the water.
</p>

<p>
"You have your revolver, of course?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Hawkshaw, with chattering teeth.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! we never know what may happen.  By-the-by,
I have got the names of those four sea-waifs;
but the captain has gone to bed."
</p>

<p>
"And who are they?" asked Hawkshaw, in a
faint voice, and half averting his face.
</p>

<p>
Heriot opened his note-book, and drawing nearer
the cabin lamp, read:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Thomas Bartelot, late master of the 'Princess,'
of London, a</i> 300<i>-ton ship, from Rio last; William
Morrison</i> (countryman of mine) <i>first-mate of the
same; Noah Gawthrop, a seaman</i>&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And the fourth?" asked Hawkshaw, in agony,
as Heriot paused.
</p>

<p>
"A young cabin passenger.  I did not get his
name, as the poor fellow was sound asleep.  They
are the soul survivors of the ship.  Good night;
we have a spanking breeze, and carry topmast
stun'sails.  Take my poncho wrapper in addition to
your railway rug."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"You'll find it cold enough, watching between
decks till sunrise."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks.  Good night," muttered Hawkshaw,
through his teeth, which the poor wretch clenched,
to prevent them chattering, so strong were his
emotions, as he passed through the door of the after
bulk-head, and sought his way, by lantern light, to
that place which was to be the scene of his great
crime, where, all unconscious of his entrance, Morley
and his three companions were swinging in their
hammocks.
</p>

<p>
About four hours after this, a cry&mdash;almost a yell
rang through the silent ship, startling the watch on
deck and the man at the helm, terrifying Mr. Basset
(whose duty it was to watch at the cabin door),
bringing Captain Phillips, Mr. Quail, and Dr. Heriot
from their berths, in dread that the great crisis of
the voyage had come, that the mutineers were in
arms; there, too, were Ethel and Rose, in their
white-laced night-dresses, the latter with her rich
hair all falling over her neck, peeping fearfully from
their cabin door, while Nurse Folgate had buried
herself under her bed-clothes, for that cry, which
"pierced the night's dull ear," was one of mortal
agony, and it seemed to come from&mdash;<i>between decks</i>!

<h3>
CHAPTER XV.
<br /><br />
A BITER BITTEN.
</h3>

<p>
After leaving the doctor, Hawkshaw, to gather
"Dutch courage," took a last mouthful from his
brandy flask, and with his slippers on, stole softly
and stealthily between decks, so softly that his
entrance was unheard by our four friends, whom he
found awake, and conversing in low tones; so he
seated himself on a chest, with his face completely
in shadow, and there he remained listening, and
scarcely daring to breathe, for with every roll of the
ship the four hammocks swung regularly to and fro,
side by side, from port to starboard, and the outer
one, in which Morley lay, nearly touched the
watcher's head at times.
</p>

<p>
The air-port was closed now, and the place was
lighted by the feeble rays of a ship-lantern, which
swung from one of the beams.
</p>

<p>
In shadow, as we have said, and with a broad
tarpaulin hat slouched over his stealthy cat-like eyes,
that flashed with malignant light, Hawkshaw sat,
or crouched, listening, watching, and waiting for the
time that would suit the attempt, eagerly, and all
but breathlessly, and the duration seemed
interminable, for he had no watch, his gold repeater
having been so summarily appropriated by Pedro
Barradas.
</p>

<p>
Morley spoke, and his voice, so long heard only
in troubled dreams, now thrilled through the heart
of Hawkshaw, causing sharp pangs of fear and
agony; yet Morley's remark was a very simple one;
but his voice, like the voices of the others, was
husky and weak.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, the delight of such a cozy bed as this, after
all we have undergone!  Eh, Tom!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Morley, lad," replied Bartelot; "but I
should like to know what craft we are on board of,
and for where bound.  I quite forgot to ask the
doctor."
</p>

<p>
"She's true British at all events, by her build
'tween decks, captain," said Noah Gawthrop.
"Thank God for all his mercies, 'specially to a
rough old salt like me.  He was very good and
kind to remember a poor old feller like Noah, that
he was, when there are so many younger and better
folks to take care of.  But I think the doctor
mentioned her name, captain."
</p>

<p>
"Her&mdash;who?"
</p>

<p>
"Why the ship, I mean, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;I am sure I heard it; she is the&mdash;the&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
(Hawkshaw trembled as Tom paused, for if the
name was uttered in Morley's hearing, he&mdash;the
listener&mdash;was lost!) "Well, it is strange that I
don't remember; but her skipper's name is Phillips,
and she hails from London.  I made out that
somehow."
</p>

<p>
"I know one Phillips&mdash;Bill Phillips, who was lost
in the Straits of Sunda.  He was once captain of
the brig <i>Erminia</i>," said Morrison.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Herminya</i>!" replied Gawthrop, "that is the
name o' the identical craft as we're aboard of; but
she is too large&mdash;too broad in the beam for a brig."
</p>

<p>
"I am weary of speaking, mates, and wish to
sleep," said Bartelot, yawning; "here, under a
good deck of British oak, we may take a long spell
of it without fear; and yet I can't help thinking of
the poor <i>Princess</i>, and all who perished with her.
Their faces are always before me."
</p>

<p>
"And that was a waluable cargo o' hers, that
was," added Noah, "and a power o' trouble we
took with the sugar and 'bacca casks at Rio.  Oh,
lor, to think of all that 'bacca goin' to Davy Jones,
and never a leaf of it being smoked or cut in quids!
She was steeved to within a fathom of her beams,
she was; and then we had Californy hides for
dunnage to the hatches&mdash;aye, aye, all gone, and I'll
never have another watch-mate like old Ben Plank
again!"
</p>

<p>
"Poor Ben!" said Morrison; "he'll never more
cheer the lads in the forecastle, or on the watch of
a clear night, with the 'Bay of Biscay' or 'Tom
Bowling,' or lead the chant of 'Time for us go,'
when shipping the capstan bars.  A better crew
than ours never hove up anchor!"
</p>

<p>
With a purpose so cruel and deadly in his mind,
it may be imagined with what exasperation and
impatience Hawkshaw listened to a conversation so
trivial, and maintained so drowsily at intervals.  He
began to hope they were dropping asleep, when old
Gawthrop spoke again.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, warn't that warm tea delicious this morning,
captain!  I doesn't think as I'll ever take
kindly to grog again, but become a regular quaker
and teetotaller."
</p>

<p>
"Not even thumb-grog, Noah, eh&mdash;on a wet
night, when a shout comes down the forescuttle, of
'All hands reef topsails!'" said Bartelot laughing.
</p>

<p>
"I am almost afraid to sleep," said Morrison,
"for dreams of the wreck always come with it, and
again I seem to find myself up to my neck in cold
salt water.  I had often in memory, while we were
drifting about, a story my mother, poor woman! used
to tell me, when I was a laddie at home, and
played truant frae the school, and when she wished
to frighten me into good behaviour; so between
sleeping and waking I used to think sometimes I
was one of the doomed men she used to speak of."
</p>

<p>
"Doomed, mate; how?" asked Morley, raising
his voice; "how were they so?"
</p>

<p>
"It was the belief of some of the seafaring folk
who dwell in the north of Scotland, that those
among them who were wicked and sinful in their
lives were roused in the night by the knocking of a
skeleton hand on their cottage doors.  The tap
sounded like that of a bony or fleshless hand,
though neither the hand or arm of the summoner
were visible to mortal eyes.  Compelled by a power
they dared not, and could not resist, those who
were so summoned left their snug beds, their wives
and bairns (if they had them), and went,
awe-stricken and sick with horror, down the beach,
where at such a time there was always a heavy sea
rolling in white foam, a black scud drifting
overhead and a storm coming on.  Compelled by the
same mysterious power that brought them forth,
the shivering wretches had to step on board a long,
black, coffin-shaped boat (which was always sunk to
its gunnel in water), and then they shoved off to
sea.  A grinning skull formed the figure-head of
this grim barge, and human bones the thole-pins.
Then a great dark cloud spread itself like a sail on
the laughing wind, and away they were borne
careering into the offing of the black and midnight
sea, from whence there was no return, for there
they had to cruise for ever, like Vanderdecken at
the Cape, until the final day of Doom!  Many a
time such boats have been seen, driving past the
lighthouse on Buchanness, and the deep caverns of
that tremendous shore, where the sea bellows for
ever and ever&mdash;sailing on and on, towards the
north, the shrieks of the despairing mingling with
the wind, on a cold winter night, when the sleet
and rain were sowing all the German sea."
</p>

<p>
"Such a diabolical story!" exclaimed Morley.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that is a lively legend of the north of
Scotland," added Bartelot; "but now silence,
mates, and let us to sleep, if we can."
</p>

<p>
Before this end, so desirable for the purpose of
Hawkshaw, was attained, he heard the middle-watch
called, and the port-tacks were brought more
on board, which showed that the wind was veering
upon the quarter; then all became still, and he
heard only the ceaseless creaking of the timbers, the
sound of the sea rushing past, the sway to and fro
of the sleepers' hammocks, and his own
half-suppressed breathing.
</p>

<p>
The idea of cutting the head-clew of Morley's
hammock, and letting him fall head-foremost on the
lower deck, occurred to Hawkshaw; and then he
preferred the idea of relaxing the clew, so that it
might seem to have given way, and the result of
such a fall in Morley's weak state would certainly
kill him, while all the blame of the event would fall
on the carpenter or sailmaker who slung the hammock.
</p>

<p>
But Hawkshaw's trembling fingers completely
failed to undo the knot of the clew&mdash;one of those
mysterious ones which sailors alone can tie and
untie&mdash;so he was compelled to relinquish the idea.
</p>

<p>
He next approached softly, to assure himself that
the four men were asleep.  He opened the lantern,
and passed the lighted candle twice across their
faces, which were still wan, pale, and weird in
aspect, after all they had so recently undergone.
</p>

<p>
He looked on Morley Ashton last, for it required
some courage to do so steadily, while memories of
the past and anticipations of the future were
conflicting in his heart.
</p>

<p>
Morning was at hand now, the first sleep of the
night was past, and the four were again in
dream-land&mdash;chiefly, perhaps, our friend Morley&mdash;in that
state which is between sleep and wakefulness.
</p>

<p>
Various shades of expression were passing over
his handsome, pale, and gentle face.  He muttered
at times, too, and gave uneasy moans and starts, for
thought, life, the soul, were still at work.  Then his
mouth wore a soft smile, as Ethel's image most
likely came before him; anon, there was a knitted
brow and stern compression of the lips, as some
fierce emotion followed; and next there came a
gaunt aspect of despair, with some memory of the
floating wreck, all evincing that, while he slept,
the reflections of life were busy amid that uneasy
slumber.
</p>

<p>
With bent brows, with haggard cheeks, with eyes
that glared snakily in fear and hate, Cramply
Hawkshaw gazed upon his victim; and as his deadly
intent came gushing up in his heart&mdash;as his cruelty
and wrath were screwed "to the sticking point," he
quietly extinguished the candle, without perceiving
that two eyes close by were watching him narrowly,
with wonder and alarm.
</p>

<p>
There was no light now, save that of the stars,
which struggled dimly and uncertainly through a
couple of yolks in the deck overhead, and through
the grating of the open hatchway.
</p>

<p>
Hawkshaw's heart panted as that of a chased
tiger might do, and the old emotion he felt on that
terrible night at Acton Chine&mdash;a lust of cruelty, of
vengeance, and destruction&mdash;swelled or glowed
within him!
</p>

<p>
A flame seemed to pass out of his eyes, while a
thousand glaring orbs appeared to fill or pierce the
obscurity about him; his breath became short and
difficult, a deafness fell upon his ears, or there came
around him an awful silence, as if the world itself
stood still.  Then his hands felt as if endued with
a giant's strength as they made a clutch at Morley's
mouth and throat, for he had resolved to strangle
or suffocate him.
</p>

<p>
But it was an attempt, and no more, for ere he
could achieve his detestable purpose, he felt his
hands seized, and one was grasped as if by the teeth
of some wild animal.
</p>

<p>
The bite, with the terror and confusion it
occasioned, so bewildered him, that the wild cry of
agony which roused all on board the ship escaped
his lips; he dealt a heavy blow in the dark at some
one or something, he knew not what, and breaking
from the strange assailant, fled, baffled, in
consternation, to the after cabin.

CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><br />
DREAD.
</h3>

<p>
"What the devil is the matter?" asked Captain
Phillips, as he hastily donned his pea-jacket, and
addressed Hawkshaw, who was seated on the cabin
locker, panting with excitement.
</p>

<p>
"Did you utter that dismal howl, Captain
Hawkshaw?" added Dr. Heriot, impatiently; "speak,
sir, have you lost your voice?"
</p>

<p>
"Very nearly, and my senses too," groaned the
other, whose cup of shame and misery was well-nigh
full now.
</p>

<p>
"What has happened?"
</p>

<p>
"Look at my hand!" said Hawkshaw, striving to
gain time for thought&mdash;to rally his scattered wits
for the coming <i>dénouement</i>&mdash;for an explanation, or
a bold defiance.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what has happened?"
</p>

<p>
"It is almost bleeding&mdash;bitten."
</p>

<p>
"By what&mdash;by whom?" asked everyone at once
</p>

<p>
"A madman."
</p>

<p>
"Mad!" was exclaimed in wild tones by all.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Hawkshaw, through his clenched
teeth, and with a glare in his eye, that seemed
somewhat akin to insanity; "one of those fellows
between-decks&mdash;one of those wretches we took off
the raft (a curse upon them all!) has bitten me."
</p>

<p>
"But which of them?" asked Heriot, who had
now completely attired himself.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't know which, and I care not which,"
replied the wretched Hawkshaw, as he rubbed and
blew his breath upon his aching digits.
</p>

<p>
"And he actually bit you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; have I not already said so?"
</p>

<p>
"What were you doing?"
</p>

<p>
"Doing&mdash;adjusting the clothes upon him," replied
Hawkshaw, after a pause; "and look you, he has
almost bitten my hand to the bone."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke he held up his right hand to the
cabin lamp, and there certainly were the marks of a
row of teeth distinctly visible, for Noah Gawthrop
had been determined to give Morley's nocturnal
assailant a stamp by which he would know him
again.
</p>

<p>
"For all that I know, he may have half strangled
one of his companions, in addition to this wild
assault upon me," added the Texan captain, as a
sudden thought occurred to him, for in his
confusion he did not know how far he had assaulted
Morley.
</p>

<p>
Heriot, a very sharp-witted and intelligent
fellow, who, at his native university, had met men
from all parts of the world, and had thus gained a
considerable insight of human character, had been
scrutinising Hawkshaw keenly, and something in
his manner, or in the expression of his face, seemed
to excite some vague suspicion&mdash;Heriot knew not
exactly of what&mdash;in his mind.
</p>

<p>
"To me this appears like an impossibility," he
began; "excuse me saying so, but what motive&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I know nothing of motives, Dr. Leslie Heriot,"
interrupted Hawkshaw, becoming furious and
desperate; "but this I know, that I may be tempted
to use my revolver with a vengeance, if I am
molested again by anyone on board this ship; be
assured of that."
</p>

<p>
At this sudden outburst, Heriot gave a smile of
well-bred surprise, and glanced at the captain, who
said:
</p>

<p>
"This is a most extraordinary and unaccountable
affair, and must be instantly inquired into.  I am
sure that the poor fellows looked quiet enough when
I saw them last.  Steward&mdash;Joe, a lantern&mdash;quick!
Come, doctor, Mr. Basset&mdash;we'll see to this."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Leslie," cried Rose, "take care, take care!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, papa&mdash;dear papa, you, at least, must not
go," added Ethel, who had now put on her morning
wrapper, or dressing-gown, and appeared at the
door of her little cabin.
</p>

<p>
"Pooh, pooh, Miss Basset, there is not the
slightest cause for fear, my dear girl," said the
captain, laughing, as Joe lit a ship-lantern.
</p>

<p>
"But the poor man's sufferings may have made
him vicious&mdash;wild."
</p>

<p>
"I'll take care of your papa, ladies; and bite the
fellow's head off, mayhap, if he bites him.  Come,
Captain Hawkshaw, and show us which of the four
is the culprit, and then, if need be, we shall get the
bilboes ready." *
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Iron shackles used on board ship to secure the feet of
prisoners.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"No, no, I cannot," replied Hawkshaw, with a
sullen and hang-dog expression in his now white
and livid face.
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;you won't go?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
The captain looked at him with a smile of contempt.
</p>

<p>
"Lead the way, captain," said Mr. Scriven
Basset, impatiently; for his ideas of legal
prerogative and position were gradually becoming
stronger as he drew near the scene of his future
judgeship&mdash;the sunny Isle of France.  "I am
anxious to see the end of this singular affair."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, most accursed fate!" murmured Hawkshaw,
as he sank upon the stern locker.  "All is over with
me now!" he added, as Mr. Basset, the captain,
Heriot, and others quitted the cabin, to go forward
between decks, and then every minute that elapsed
seemed at least an hour.
</p>

<p>
The cabin appeared to whirl round him like a
great revolving cylinder; there was a confused hum
of voices, that seemed to mingle with the rush of
many waters, in his ear.
</p>

<p>
Again his former thoughts of suicide occurred to
him; but his soul shrank within him at the idea of
self-destruction.  A loaded revolver was close by;
he glanced at it with haggard and wistful eyes.
One bullet would enable him to escape the coming
shame, and by so doing, he would gain a triumph&mdash;a
ghastly victory over them all.
</p>

<p>
But then he thought of a suicide's grave in the
midnight sea; shot off a grating to leeward, without
even a prayer, and shudderingly he withdrew his
hand, and closing his eyes, muttered, with quivering
lips:
</p>

<p>
"No, no&mdash;I cannot&mdash;I cannot."
</p>

<p>
At this moment a soft little hand was laid gently
upon his, and looking up he beheld Ethel Basset.
</p>

<p>
Ignorant of all this man's secret life; of his
crimes committed in wild and lawless lands; the
wrong and cruelty of which he had been guilty to
herself and to Morley&mdash;she surveyed him with
something of pity, and he gazed at her bewildered,
and in silence, thinking that she never looked so
lovely as at this terrible moment of his humiliation
and suspense.
</p>

<p>
She wore a loose and ample morning wrapper, of
white stuff, spotted with red; it was profusely
frilled, and fitted closely round her delicate throat,
and her tapered white arms came softly out from its
wide falling sleeves.  A white tasselled cord
confined it at the waist, and she had no ornament about
her, save Morley Ashton's ring.
</p>

<p>
Turned hastily off her face, and behind her white
and handsome ears, her dark, glossy, and glorious
hair fell in a long mass down her back, and she was
knotting it up with her right hand (thus showing to
perfection a smooth white arm and dimpled elbow),
while her left, so soft and small, rested on the hand
of Hawkshaw; the hand that only five minutes
before had aimed a death-clutch at the throat of
Morley Ashton.
</p>

<p>
She gazed kindly and inquiringly into his pale
and agitated face, for his present wretched and
guilty aspect astonished and perplexed her.
</p>

<p>
Her colour, always so delicate, was somewhat
heightened beyond its usual roseleaf tint, by the
late excitement, and, as we have said, Hawkshaw,
with all his selfishness, with all his guilt and
bloodthirstiness, thought he never beheld her
looking so lovely and so pure as at this, to him, most
terrible time.
</p>

<p>
She was about to speak, when several footsteps
were heard coming towards the great cabin, on
which she retired hastily to her own, and shut the
door.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my God! they are coming to denounce me!
Peril&mdash;disgrace&mdash;ruin, and no escape but death!"
groaned Hawkshaw, covering his eyes with one
hand, while the other fell, by chance&mdash;or was it
fatality!&mdash;on the cold butt of the loaded revolver.

CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><br />
UNMASKED.
</h3>

<p>
The time spent by the captain and his companions
in the place where the four castaways were located
must have appeared interminable to the wretched
Hawkshaw, as they remained there fully an hour,
for much had to be inquired into, and much more
related and explained.
</p>

<p>
Resolved to question, cross-question, sift, and
refine, and all unconscious of the surprise that was
awaiting him, Mr. Basset, with tolerable lawyer-like
activity and importance, fussily followed jolly
Captain Phillips, who had one hand stuffed into
that pocket of his pea-jacket which held his
revolver, and in the other hand he swung a ship's
lantern.
</p>

<p>
To Mr. Basset's unpractised eye, the 'tween
decks seemed rather a dreary den, to say the best
of it.  It was lower in height, or, to write more
correctly, between beams, than the ship's cabin,
and its furniture was exceedingly simple, consisting
only of a small breaker or gang-cask, and wooden
drinking tot, set upon a sea-chest which was securely
lashed to the bulkhead, while a railway rug and
poncho wrapper lay thereby.
</p>

<p>
Then his eye caught four queer-looking long
bags, that swung by clews and cleats from the
beams longitudinally, and ont of each of the
aforesaid bags a human face was peering, with eyes
expressive of inquiry and interest; but their
features could not be discerned, for all was
darkness, or nearly so, except where the light of the
lantern fell.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo, my friends," said Captain Phillips, as he
held his lantern up, and took a rapid survey of
them all, "so you are awake, I see.  What the
deuce has been doing here, that we are all turned
up in the night, or rather the middle of the morning
watch, in this way, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand what it is all about, sir,"
replied Tom Bartelot; "but a few minutes ago, in
my sleep, I heard a terrible cry."
</p>

<p>
"Who was it that bit the gentleman?" asked
Phillips, angrily.
</p>

<p>
"I did, your honour," replied Noah Gawthrop,
looking over the edge of his hammock, and twitching
his grizzled forelock.
</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;and you acknowledge it!" said the captain,
turning towards him with angry surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; and I hope as I have left the marks o' my
blessed grinders in him, that's all."
</p>

<p>
"The fellow is mad," said Mr. Basset in an
undertone.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think so?"
</p>

<p>
"Who else would talk thus?"
</p>

<p>
"Likely enough, sir," whispered Joe, the steward;
"for I heard that old one this morning saying that
he was tormented by a marine drummer, and shouting
for all hands to reef topsails.  He seemed to
think himself on board a man-o'-war."
</p>

<p>
"A little crazed, perhaps, by recent suffering,"
suggested Mr. Basset.  "A short sleep may soothe
him; but a bite is a serious offence&mdash;a very serious
offence."
</p>

<p>
"I ain't no more mad than your honour," said
Noah, who had overheard their whispers, and
looked up angrily; then he added, in a different
tone, "But&mdash;is that you, Captain Phillips&mdash;lor'
bless you, don't you mind o' me?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I do not," replied the captain, curtly.
</p>

<p>
"Not remember old Noah Gawthrop, as sailed
for ten year and more with your brother, Captain
Bill, and was wrecked with him in the Straits of
Sunda?"
</p>

<p>
"Noah, it is, by Jupiter!" exclaimed Phillips,
shaking the old seaman's hand with genuine warmth.
"This is, indeed, strange; 'tis long since we last
met, Noah."
</p>

<p>
"Five years ago, if it is a day, since I came home
from the West Ingees, and ran up the Mersey in a
old sweating sugar-ship&mdash;her berths aft and bunks
for'ard a swarming with bugs and cockroaches, a
crew of Jamaiky darkies, and her lower rigging all
alive with poll-parrots.  I see you minds o' me,
Captain Phillips&mdash;lor' bless me, in course you does,
and know that I am no more mad than yourself, or
my own good captain here, Mr. Thomas Bartelot,
of the <i>Princess</i> as was, poor old craft."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, glad to see you, captain," said Phillips,
shaking hands with Tom on this blunt introduction;
"and glad too, that we came so opportunely to save
you."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," resumed Noah, "I'm the man as saved
your nevvy, Master Bill, when all hands went down
in the Straits of Sunda, and I brought the child
home with me, and gave him to yourself, as your
honour very well knows.  I was father and mother,
dry nurse, and wet nurse, and everything to that
'ere boy, I was; and many a time I rope's-ended
him, too, for putting plugs o' powder in my 'baccy
pipe, or japanning the starn o' my trousers with
new pitch.  So you knows me well enough."
</p>

<p>
"Of course I do, Noah, my brave old salt."
</p>

<p>
"Of course you does.  Ah, sir, your brother,
Captain Bill, would never have been lost, but in
passing the straits during a south-east monsoon, he
hugged the coast of Java, with his port tacks
aboard, and so we went bump ashore on a blessed
coral reef, where the sea made clean breaches over
us.  I made a grab at Master Bill, who was hauling
his pet tom-cat by the tail out o' the wash to
leeward, and then we all crouched under the
weather-bulwarks, ready to cut away the masts, if
necessary.  But the sea saved us the trouble; for
there came a regular snorer, that carried away the
topmasts at the caps, breaking them sharp off like
'baccy pipes, the midship-house, boats, and everything
went to leeward, while the ship parted, breaking
her back fairly on the reef.  I found myself in
the dark, swimming away for the bare life, among
sharks and long seaweed, with little Bill riding
on my back like Sinbad's Old Man o' the Sea, and,
top of all, the tom-cat, holding on to Bill with all
his claws out.  'Hold on, you young warmint,' says
I, and so he did, until we got ashore, and next day
we were sent off by the Dutch in a queer jigamaree,
with a lateen sail forward, and a dandy in her starn,
to a British man-o'-war, that was bearing through
the straits on a taut bowline, before the same
monsoon that finished us off on the coral reef."
</p>

<p>
"But why did you bite the man?" asked Captain
Phillips, who had listened with some impatience,
returning to the matter in hand.
</p>

<p>
"Because he is a pirate, if ever one broke biscuit!'
</p>

<p>
"Take care, Noah; he is one of our cabin passengers."
</p>

<p>
"I was a watching him, your honour, and I had
queer suspicions that he meant foul play to one of
us at least, and so I pretended to snooze, keeping
watch with one eye open, though he did pass the
light twice athwart my face.  I saw him, your
honour, though he doused the glim, and I could
make out that he was going to strangle&mdash;to garotte,
in true Californy style&mdash;my shipmate here, young
Master Morley Ashton, who was asleep&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Morley Ashton!" exclaimed Mr. Basset,
in an excited voice, as he hurried round to the other
side of the hammock; "I should like to see the
gentleman who is named so."
</p>

<p>
"Surely I should know that voice!" cried Morley,
springing up in his hammock, and almost falling
back within it, overwhelmed by astonishment on
finding himself face to face with Mr. Basset&mdash;with
the father of Ethel!
</p>

<p>
"What is this?&mdash;who is this?  You, Morley
Ashton, on board the <i>Hermione</i>?" exclaimed Mr. Basset,
in a gust of genuine bewilderment, equalled
only by that of Morley, who trembled with
anticipation and astonishment, and who felt at his heart
a sudden and clamorous joy.  "You one of the four
men taken from that melancholy wreck!  How
came it to be?  Explain&mdash;tell me.  Good
heavens! how?  Oh, my poor boy, Morley, we have long
numbered you with the dead, and have mourned for
you as such&mdash;none more, believe me, than my
dearest girl."
</p>

<p>
"Where am I, sir?&mdash;what ship is this?" stammered
Morley, as a new light began to break in
upon him, while grasping Mr. Basset's hand, with
one arm thrown caressingly round his neck.  "Am
I on board the <i>Hermione</i>?  Has she picked us
up&mdash;saved us from death?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir; this is the <i>Hermione</i>, of London," said
Captain Phillips, "too long delayed by contrary
winds, and the loss of a mast near the Canaries."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Morley Ashton," began Mr. Basset, "if
you did but know&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ashton?&mdash;Ashton?" interrupted the captain;
"are you the gentleman who was to have sailed
with us&mdash;who telegraphed for a cabin berth, and
was not forthcoming when we dropped down the
river?"
</p>

<p>
"I am the same, sir."
</p>

<p>
"What came of you?  How did you disappear?"
</p>

<p>
"I was a victim to the foulest treachery and
cowardice!"
</p>

<p>
"At the hands of whom?" asked Mr. Basset.
</p>

<p>
"Cramply Hawkshaw."
</p>

<p>
"What! he whom Gawthrop bit in the dark?"
</p>

<p>
"Bit, that I might know him again, your honour,
for I warn't strong enough to grapple with him."
</p>

<p>
"And who, he says, attempted to strangle you in
your sleep?" asked Dr. Heriot, coming forward.
</p>

<p>
"Hawkshaw here! on board with you&mdash;with
<i>her</i>!" said Morley, in a faint voice, as certain
undefinable, but terrible, suspicions arose in his
mind.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; he is with us, a cabin passenger," replied
Mr. Basset.
</p>

<p>
"Here! here! on board the <i>Hermione</i>?" continued
Morley, almost vacantly, for his brain spun
round.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, in your place," said the captain.
</p>

<p>
"Great Heavens!"
</p>

<p>
"Your passage was taken out, your berth ready,
the money paid; but you had slipped from your
moorings somehow, so he went in your place.  There
is nothing very wonderful in that, is there?"
</p>

<p>
"He went with Ethel?" said Morley, in a
tremulous and imploring voice to Mr. Basset.
</p>

<p>
"He came with me, as the son of my old friend,
Tom Hawkshaw, of Lincoln's Inn, to push his
fortune in the Mauritius," said Mr. Basset, hastily.
</p>

<p>
"And Ethel&mdash;Ethel?" continued Morley, in a
broken voice, while his eyes filled with tears.
</p>

<p>
"Is well, though she has mourned for you
deeply," replied Mr. Basset.  "But pray be calm,
my poor boy.  How terribly agitated you are!  Do
not doubt her, or misunderstand me."
</p>

<p>
"And I shall see her&mdash;see her again?"
</p>

<p>
"Very soon&mdash;in ten minutes, perhaps."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, this is indeed happiness," sighed Morley,
sinking back in his hammock.  "Heaven is kind&mdash;most
singularly merciful to me.  But Hawkshaw&mdash;that
wretch!" he added, starting up with new
energy.  "Oh, Ethel must shun, avoid and loathe
him, for she knows not that he is an assassin!"
</p>

<p>
"How an assassin?"
</p>

<p>
"Or one who would be such."
</p>

<p>
"A regular-built pirate, and no mistake&mdash;a
rascally Californy piccaroon!" added Noah, with
sundry adjectives, which we feel the propriety of
omitting.
</p>

<p>
"Aye, Mr. Basset, as Douglas Jerrold says, 'he
is a scoundrel, who would whet a knife on his
father's tombstone to kill his mother.'  Oh, you
know him not as I too surely, too truly, and too
well know him, and all of which he is capable."
</p>

<p>
"These are severe and sweeping assertions.
Explain this enigma&mdash;this most unaccountable
affair."
</p>

<p>
"You remember, Mr. Basset, the night of my
sudden disappearance from Laurel Lodge?"
</p>

<p>
"I shall never forget it.  You had gone to Acton
station, concerning a telegram from London."
</p>

<p>
"Concerning a berth in this very ship!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Returning alone, I met Cramply Hawkshaw,
who entered into conversation with me, offered me
a cigar, gradually lured me to the summit of the
rocks above the Chine.  There we sat listening to
the village chimes in the old church tower, chatting,
smoking, and enjoying the pleasant breeze from the
Bristol Channel, till he, inspired by rivalry, jealousy,
and hate, or by some fiendish combination of them
all, at a moment when I was completely off my
guard, by one furious blow struck me over the cliff
into the Chine!"
</p>

<p>
"The Chine&mdash;oh, my God!" said Mr. Basset, in
a voice that sank low with horror.  "We came to
look for you, Cramply and I, for he said that he
had seen you walking there, and certainly we found
marks of a struggle&mdash;the gravel dislodged, and the
turf torn.  You fell into the sea of course, but from
that height!  How&mdash;by what miracle did you escape?"
</p>

<p>
"A miracle, a narrow chance indeed!  A turf-covered
ledge received me, and there for many,
many hours, more than a night and a day, I
remained sleepless, and scarcely daring to move,
chilled less perhaps by the cold sea-breeze than by
the horror of drowning if I rolled off the narrow
shelf, of dying slowly by starvation and falling a
prey to the sea-birds at last, till I was saved by my
friend Captain Bartelot, whose vessel passed below me."
</p>

<p>
Excited by the memory of all he had undergone,
Morley's voice faltered and grew weak as he
spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," said Bartelot, striking in, "we chanced
to see a human figure perched up among the gulls
and cormorants, so we made a longer tack close in
shore, and sent off a boat's crew, who climbed to the
top of the rocks and hove him the end of a line.
He was then towed up, and being quite insensible,
Morrison, my mate, brought him on board.  So, being
outward bound&mdash;a storm having been signalled by
Admiral Fitzroy, and beginning to break white in
the offing, we had no time for backing and filling,
or chopping about the rocky shore at Acton&mdash;I
stood right down the Channel, intending to put him
aboard the first suitable ship.  We never overhauled
any but foreigners, so we took him with us to Rio.
He has often been well-nigh out of his mind
sometimes, sir, about&mdash;I may be pardoned mentioning
her name&mdash;Miss Basset; but he was in safe hands
with me, sir, his old schoolfellow, Tom Bartelot."
</p>

<p>
"A strange and terrible story!" exclaimed Dr. Heriot.
</p>

<p>
"Poor Ethel, Morley," said Mr. Basset; "oh,
what she has endured, and in silence, too!"
</p>

<p>
"I can know that well, by what I, too, endured.
Dear, dear Ethel; and I shall see her&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"So soon as she can be wisely informed of the
great surprise, of the great joy, that await her.
But that fellow, Hawkshaw&mdash;the fact of how I have
been duped, deluded, and disgraced by the
pretended friendship of such a man, falls like a
thunderbolt upon me!" exclaimed good, easy
Mr. Scriven Basset, with more energy than he was
wont to exhibit, "and to think of my poor, sweet,
and virtuous girls being contaminated by the
society of such a man, and my secluded home
being polluted by his presence, though sheltered
there under the name of his good and worthy
father!  Damme! it's enough to make one
suspicious of all mankind!"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Basset thrust one hand into his breast, and
the other under the tails of his coat, and trod to
and fro the whole length of the 'tween-decks, about
twelve feet or so, swelling and reddening with just
ire and indignation.
</p>

<p>
Bartelot, Morrison, and Gawthrop added many
details corroborating the remarkable escape of
Morley from Acton Chine, and descriptive of his
mental sufferings during the voyage to Rio de
Janeiro; and by the time this interview, so full
of stirring interest to all concerned in it, was over,
and the captain and his companions had quitted
the 'tween-decks, a new day had dawned, the sun
was rising brightly from the sea, and throwing the
shadow of the lofty <i>Hermione</i> far astern upon the
gleaming waters to the westward.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><br />
THE EXPULSION.
</h3>

<p>
Hawkshaw's hand, as we have stated, fell
unconsciously on the loaded revolver which lay by his
side, but was instantly withdrawn.
</p>

<p>
He had not the courage to die by his own hand,
in the fashion to which the old Romans were so
partial in all their griefs and difficulties.  He looked
up with a half-haggard and half-bullying or defiant
expression, as Captain Phillips, Mr. Quail, the
doctor, and Mr. Basset entered the cabin.
</p>

<p>
The latter gave him a long, steady, and withering
glance, and after knocking at the door of
Ethel's little cabin or state-room, entered it hastily.
Then the varying exclamations of astonishment
and joy which were heard within it sounded
as additional knells of disgrace&mdash;they might be
those of death to Cramply Hawkshaw; and now,
after surveying him long and sternly, Captain
Phillips addressed him with great deliberation.
</p>

<p>
Hawkshaw found himself regarded with horror
and aversion, but no ashes of fire were heaped upon
his miserable head, for the good, jolly captain was
the only person who spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Sir, give me up that revolver."
</p>

<p>
Hawkshaw seemed to be stunned, and did not
reply.
</p>

<p>
"The revolver, sir; do you hear me?"
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind why or wherefore&mdash;they matter
little now."
</p>

<p>
"I thought that we were all armed for a
particular purpose."
</p>

<p>
Captain Phillips smiled bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said he; "but you can be no longer
trusted with arms on board my ship."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!" said Hawkshaw, who knew not very
well whether to cringe or bully, and pondered in
his desperation.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; so surrender your arms.  I'm an easy-going
fellow, but one who won't be trifled with, for
all that.  Your revolver!"
</p>

<p>
Hawkshaw reluctantly handed Captain Phillips
the loaded weapon.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you.  Now, sir, I must inform you that
we have had a long interview with the men in the
'tween-decks&mdash;those whom you so kindly undertook
to watch, though such a duty was scarcely necessary&mdash;and
after the revelations they have made, but
chiefly after the account given of you by Mr. Morley
Ashton&mdash;you wince at the name, I see&mdash;you can no
longer remain in the cabin of the <i>Hermione</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Revelations!  Did I not say that one&mdash;one at
least&mdash;of these men was mad?"
</p>

<p>
"You shall not be sent forward," continued the
captain, "among my crew, however congenial some
of their spirits may be."
</p>

<p>
"What, then?" asked Hawkshaw, with undisguised alarm.
</p>

<p>
"You shall be secluded between decks till the
end of the voyage, or be sent on shore at the first
land we make, in the hope that we may never see
you more."
</p>

<p>
"At the Cape of Good Hope?" asked Hawkshaw eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"I do not mean to touch at the Cape now, as we
are so far to the southward of it," replied the
captain, little foreseeing that this information was to
have a fatal influence over all on board.
</p>

<p>
"Sir," replied Hawkshaw, gathering courage for
a moment, "may I remind you that my passage
to the Isle of France&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Is paid for, you would say?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;<i>carambi</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"By Mr. Ashton's money.  Ha! ha!  I have
known of a man being marooned on a rock in the
Gulf of Florida&mdash;aye, or set adrift on a hencoop, or
in a punt, with three biscuits and a bottle of water,
in the middle of the South Pacific&mdash;a poor devil
who was far less criminal than you.  I would to
Heaven we had never seen you.  No ship with such
a thorough-bred rascal on board could hope for a
prosperous voyage; and," continued the captain
angrily, as his professional superstitions came to
memory, "the fact of having you with us sufficiently
accounts for the loss of our foremast after passing
the Madeira Isles, for the mysterious loss of poor
Manfredi, and the head winds we have uniformly
encountered.  Why, damme! we might as well
have had a parson, or an undocked Tom cat aboard.
Seclusion from among us is a punishment slight
indeed for the crimes of which you have been guilty,
but chiefly for your double and dastardly attempts
upon the life of that young gentleman.  You
understand me, sir."
</p>

<p>
"I understand only, Captain Phillips, that your
mind has been poisoned by a parcel of infamous
falsehoods, which, on the first shore we make, I shall
ram down the throat of him who uttered them with
a pistol-bullet!"
</p>

<p>
"I hope the person referred to will not be such a
confounded donkey as to exchange shots with a
convicted assassin," replied Phillips.
</p>

<p>
"Assassin!  I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Choking with sudden and uncontrollable passion,
Hawkshaw sprang up from the locker, his bloodshot
eyes flashing with fire, his face pale and haggard,
the veins of his temples swollen like whipcord,
and his heart stung with the idea that Ethel in her
little cabin could hear all that passed.  His voice,
husky and inarticulate, failed him, but his bearing
was so threatening that Captain Phillips cocked the
revolver pistol, and said, sternly:
</p>

<p>
"If you attempt to strike me, I will shoot you
down like a gull.  Quit the cabin this instant, and
if you would keep your heels out of the bilboes,
never let me find you aft the break of the quarterdeck."
</p>

<p>
Hawkshaw's hands were opened and clenched
convulsively, as if his fingers twitched for an object to
grapple with, and on which to vent the pent-up rage
and shame that consumed him; yet he found that
he had no resource but to submit and retire, so he
slowly left the cabin, but with an air of defiance
which so ill became him, and so ill befitted his
present predicament, that Phillips, the mate, and
doctor, knew not whether to pity or laugh at him.
</p>

<p>
But the whole episode was a painful one, as they
could not forget, at this climax of his humiliation,
that this man, so summarily disgraced and cast forth
from among them as an unclean thing, had been for
so many months their companion and associate, their
friend, and, to all appearance, their equal.
</p>

<p>
He repaired to the quarter-deck, and the cool
breeze that swept over the morning sea gratefully
fanned his flushed face and throbbing brow.  For a
time he was blind with rage, and trod mechanically
to and fro over the very cabin wherein Ethel and
Rose (now filled with tumultuous joy by the strange
tidings their father had brought them, were making
a hurried toilette); till the appearance of Mr. Quail,
who came to relieve the deck, to call the watch, to
change the helmsman, and have the log hove, recalled
the stern order of Captain Phillips, and,
descending the break of the quarter-deck, he went
sullenly forward&mdash;a proscribed man.
</p>

<p>
As he did so a mocking laugh met his ear.
</p>

<p>
It came from Pedro Barradas&mdash;who had just
relieved the wheel, and who, being ignorant of the
events that had transpired in the cabin, naturally
supposed that Hawkshaw had, as usual, quitted the
quarter-deck to avoid him.
</p>

<p>
For a moment this laugh stung him deeply; but
many emotions were conflicting in his breast on this
miserable morning, so that he scarcely felt anger at
Barradas.
</p>

<p>
He had passed a sleepless night; but no sensation
of weariness felt he, as he clambered into the
fore-rigging, and sat there to consider his position&mdash;to
watch the inmates of the cabin, and to avoid the
crew, until he could conceal himself somewhere for
the night.
</p>

<p>
Oh, how he longed for its friendly shadow and
concealment&mdash;longed for it, while the beams of the
morning sun gilded all the sea, and lit up the full
swelling sails of the <i>Hermione</i>.
</p>

<p>
Feverish, and madly excited by the many emotions
which had convulsed him since the moment in which
he recognised the sleeping Morley Ashton, and more
especially by the terrible and wicked thoughts of the
past night, a longing for vengeance, or victory,
rather&mdash;victory at any risk or price&mdash;filled his heart,
till he nearly became mad, when thoughts of his
rival's safety, restoration, and triumph were
contrasted with his own exposure, expulsion, and
disgrace.
</p>

<p>
The crew, among whom he dared not venture,
would soon learn the whole story, and, knowing
alike their reckless character and their nefarious
projects, he already felt, by anticipation, the sharp
stings of their fierce and brutal mockery, and the
coming vengeance of those he had contemptuously
ignored&mdash;the Barradas.
</p>

<p>
"Why did I not put a bullet through my head
before old Phillips took away my pistol?" thought
he.  "Had I done so, by this time, perhaps, I
would have been peacefully at rest below the surface
of that blue and shining sea, instead of being
perched up here, a moody wretch&mdash;a miserable and
disappointed outcast."
</p>

<p>
Slowly, slowly the sunny morning wore on.
</p>

<p>
He heard Joe the steward's bell&mdash;once a welcome
sound&mdash;rung for breakfast.  The smoking ham and
eggs, broiled chicken, tea and coffee, were borne
from the steaming galley, aft to the cabin; he
knew that the whole party, with their familiar faces,
would be assembled at table as usual; and others,
too, he shrewdly anticipated, would be there.  Nor
was he mistaken; for all the four castaways were
so much better this morning, notwithstanding the
recent disturbance, that they had quitted their
hammocks, with the intention of coming on deck.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps they had already begun to feel that
necessity which so soon impresses the sick or ailing
on board of ship&mdash;the expediency of getting well as
soon as possible (especially in such a ship as the
<i>Hermione</i>); for, after a time, there is but little
sympathy to spare for useless hands, either fore or
aft; "an overstrained sense of manliness being the
characteristic of seafaring men, or rather of life on
board ship."
</p>

<p>
Apart from these considerations, and being
bodily better, the knowledge that Ethel Basset was
only separated from him by a few planks worked a
miracle upon Morley Ashton.
</p>

<p>
Their sodden and surf-beaten rags had all been
thrown overboard, so Morley was attired from
the wardrobe of Dr. Heriot; the others were
supplied by the captain and Mr. Basset; and the
appearance of Noah Gawthrop, when rigged out in
a black swallow-tailed dress coat, belonging to the
latter gentleman, with gilt buttons, and lappels of
watered silk, an old crimson velvet waistcoat, an
ample pair of dark tartan trowsers, and a
sou'-wester of Mr. Quail's, was unique, and excited
considerable speculation when he came on deck.
</p>

<p>
Forgetting his "landlubber-like toggery," with
sailor-like instinct, Noah cast his eyes aloft, and
critically surveyed all the rigging, and a smile, that
puckered up the wrinkles of his old face, showed
that the result of his scrutiny was satisfactory.
</p>

<p>
His remarkably ill-favoured visage was in no way
improved by a patch of black sticking-plaster, with
which Dr. Heriot had covered a cut on the bridge
of his copper-coloured nose, the result of
Hawkshaw's random blow in the matutinal row between
decks.
</p>

<p>
Descending the break of the quarter-deck, Noah
went forward, to get his breakfast with the crew,
concerning whom the officers of the ship deemed it
yet unwise to give him any warning.
</p>

<p>
He had considerably recovered his strength, and
was eagerly welcomed by the seamen as he walked
forward, and all gathered in a group about him in
the break of the deck at the forecastle bunks,
clamorous to hear his yarn about the loss of his
ship&mdash;where she was from, where bound to, what she
was loaded with, and so forth&mdash;to hear all about
himself, and, though recorded last, not the least
exciting topic on which they wished enlightenment,
was the cry that had come from between decks in
the first hour of the morning watch.
</p>

<p>
Noah, seated on the barrel of the windlass, with
a tin mug of scalding hot coffee, together with a
slice of salt junk, and Quaco's "plum-duff," after
denouncing the tea and arrowroot of Joe the
steward, proceeded to give, in his own fashion, a
rambling narrative of all the recent events in which
he had borne a part.
</p>

<p>
The words which he uttered did not reach the
ear of Hawkshaw, in his lofty perch; but suddenly
all eyes were simultaneously cast aloft to where he
sat near the sling of the foreyard, and Noah
threateningly shook his clenched hand at him,
while a roar of mocking laughter from the crew&mdash;that
bitter laughter which he so long dreaded&mdash;filled
his heart with rage and spite, that he nearly
fell from his seat among his tormentors.
</p>

<p>
For a time, it seemed as if all these villainous
upturned faces&mdash;the thick, African nose and
sausage-like lips of Quaco, the glittering eyes and
olive face of Zuares Barradas, the hideous squat
form of Sharkey&mdash;a wretch with the life of
Manfredi to atone for&mdash;Badger, with his sunken orbs
and great square jaw; Bolter, the unhealthy-looking
Canadian, and all the rest&mdash;had been turned into
mocking fiends, who would yet drive him to more
desperate deeds, for he was now expelled, cast forth
from among those with whom he had associated,
without a prospect of return, or a hope of retrieving
himself.
</p>

<p>
"Is not life altogether a long comedy," says
some one, "with Fate for the stage-manager, and
Passion, Inclination, Love, Hate, Revenge,
Ambition, Avarice, by turns, in the prompter's box?"
</p>

<p>
Hawkshaw felt bitterly in his soul that his life
had been a tragedy, in which the evil passions alone
had played their parts by turns, and sometimes all
together.
</p>

<p>
What would the last scene of that tragedy be?
</p>

<p>
"Hallo, foretop there!" cried Bill Badger, the
tall, lantern-jawed, and odious Yankee.  "Well,
capting, I guess you're chawed up rayther.  Thunder
and lightning! come, ship with us in the little
game we've got in hand.  Jine us; you carn't do
better now; and who knows but you may get your
gal with the black shiners, after all?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>El cuchillo primero!</i> (My knife first)" said
Zuares Barradas, touching the haft of his Albacete
knife with ferocious significance.
</p>

<p>
Honest Noah opened his eyes very wide at these
singular remarks, which were followed by another
roar of brutal laughter.  On this, Hawkshaw, to
get, if possible, beyond the reach of their conversation,
trembling in every limb with rage, and with a
strange blindness coming over his sight, as the old
clamorous ferocity gathered in his soul, while feeling
that the mocking words had not been uttered in
vain&mdash;as they suggested certain ideas of probable
vengeance on his exposers&mdash;proceeded to climb
farther up the rigging, until he perched himself on
the fore-crosstrees, his past experience having made
him seaman enough to achieve this.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><br />
THE MEETING.
</h3>

<p>
How shall I describe the almost mute meeting
between Ethel Basset and Morley Ashton? or shall
I omit it altogether?
</p>

<p>
Instinctively, and with proper good taste, all in
the cabin left them to themselves for a time; and
even Rose&mdash;the saucy and impulsive Rose&mdash;who
looked just as Morley had last seen her when
playing at croquet in Acton Chase, with her pretty
straw hat, her green zouave jacket, and tiny bronzed
Balmoral boots, after rushing back to give him one
kiss more, tripped upstairs on deck to join the
doctor.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Basset had managed to break the matter&mdash;the
vast secret&mdash;to Ethel skilfully and gently, by
saying that the wrecked men could afford some
information concerning Morley Ashton; that they
knew where he was, that one had seen him lately,
that he was alive and well, and so forth.  Thus there
was no scene, no screaming, no fainting for joy, and
certainly no dying of that pleasant emotion.  Such
a climax as the latter would have put the narrator
of these events very much about indeed, for, our
story being a true one, this little romantic portion
of it dovetails with the rest&mdash;rather flatly, perhaps,
because it is <i>true</i>.
</p>

<p>
For a time neither could exactly "realise" (to use
a good Americanism) that they were reunited&mdash;Ethel,
that Morley lived; Morley, that he should so
suddenly find himself by the side of her whom he
had been pursuing through the deep, reunited, and
on board the <i>Hermione</i>, of London.
</p>

<p>
Again and again she fell upon his breast,
repeating, in a voice that was almost breathless, but
exquisitely touching:
</p>

<p>
"My darling&mdash;oh, my darling! can this be
possible?  Is this reality?"
</p>

<p>
Their poor hearts were too full to permit much to
be said; nor would it be fair to them, or interesting
to others, to rehearse all the little that they did say
then.  But how much had they to ask, to relate, to
explain, and to deplore?
</p>

<p>
Morley had undergone so much, he had seen so
many strange faces, and places too&mdash;Rio de Janeiro,
with bay, mountains, and isles; Tristan d'Acunha,
with its cliffs and mighty cone; Diego Alvarez, with
its sea-elephants and fur seals; the Island of the
Hermit, with its strange story of old Don Pedro
de Barradas.  He had encountered, moreover, so
many gales of wind, the wreck, with all its
contingent woes and horrors, and so forth, that Laurel
Lodge, and Ethel's face, figure, and whole image
had seemed ten years off&mdash;at least, ten years
appeared to have elapsed since their sudden separation.
</p>

<p>
To poor Ethel the intervening blank had seemed
greater, for Morley had lived with hope, while she
had none; and, to understand and conceive her
utter bewilderment, we must bear in mind all she
had undergone.
</p>

<p>
The sudden and unaccountable disappearance of
Morley, and the supposed mode of his death (for it
was only supposed, after all), had occasioned a more
bitter sorrow, a keener and more protracted agony,
than she could have endured by weeping at his
deathbed, and afterwards knowing that he was at
rest in a grave she could see, where she might plant
flowers and drop her tears.
</p>

<p>
To have seen him borne forth from Laurel Lodge
to Acton churchyard, amid all the real and paid-for
pageantry of woe, would have been actual contentment,
when contrasted with all she had suffered&mdash;doubt,
uncertainty, despair!
</p>

<p>
Oh, she felt how deeply she must loathe Hawkshaw
as the author of all their woe!
</p>

<p>
But now Morley was beside her, with her hands
in his, looking lovingly into her loving eyes, drinking
in her murmured words, sitting close, very close, to
her, so this reunion was as stunning and bewildering
in its own way as their separation had been.
</p>

<p>
They were dearer to each other now by a thousand
degrees than ever they were before, even after
Morley's absence in Africa.
</p>

<p>
"It is good sometimes to be absent," says a graceful
writer, truthfully; "better still to be dead, as
regards our own imperfections and our equally
imperfect friends.  How they rise up and praise us for
virtues we never possessed, and benignly pardon us
for sins we never committed.  How tender over our
memories grow those who, living, worried our lives
out, and might do so again, if we were alive,
to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
They had none of those upbraiding thoughts to
recall.  Can it be reality, this happiness? was the
uppermost idea in both their minds.
</p>

<p>
It was indeed Ethel whose head reclined upon his
breast.  She was changed since last they met at
peaceful Laurel Lodge, among its rose-bowers, its
giant laurels and stately sycamores; and yet how
lovely she was&mdash;lovelier even now than then.
</p>

<p>
Long grieving had imparted a sweet Madonna-like
sadness to the soft features; her cheeks were thin,
and Morley's affectionate eye could see two white
hairs amid the deep black braiding of the young
girl's head; and he saw, too, that her broad, low
brow, had an impress of care and sorrow&mdash;sorrow
for him, even now, when her dark eyes were flashing
through their tears of joy.
</p>

<p>
It was indeed she, that beloved one, whose name
he had so dotingly murmured to himself a thousand
times, in the lonely watches of the night, when
treading the ship's deck under the sparkling stars of
the tropics, when the glorious planets of the Southern
Cross&mdash;fabled by the devout mariners of the old
Spanish Argosies to be "a brooch taken from the
breast of the blessed <i>Madre de Dios</i>"&mdash;looked close
and nigh, so close as to cast the ship's shadow on the
rolling waters.
</p>

<p>
It was she whom he had imagined in those wild
dreams by day, when the dreams of the waking are
wilder by far than those of the sleeper.
</p>

<p>
She was beside him again, and they were hand in
hand as of old, eye bent on eye, lip meeting lip.
Ethel, his own Ethel&mdash;after all they had undergone&mdash;was
beside him, so suddenly, so unexpectedly, that
it seemed indeed a dream, or like a set scene, the
plot or conception of a sensational romance or
playwright&mdash;a trafficker in plots, contrivances, and
<i>situations</i>.
</p>

<p>
It was so, and truth proved stronger than fiction
after all!
</p>

<p>
And so, forgetful of others, forgetful assuredly of
breakfast, till Joe in the steerage and Quaco in the
galley were in despair about the eggs and coffee,
they would have sat till the sun that now shone
through amber clouds so merrily ahead to the
eastward had beamed his farewell rays in crimson
through the stern-windows from the westward, had
not Joe's bell, rung vigorously and impatiently for
the third time, brought the whole party, including
Mr. Foster, who had no sympathy whatever for
lovers, and who felt famished, having had charge of
the deck since 4 to 8 A.M.&mdash;the morning watch&mdash;and
it was now half-past 10, alike by his appetite and
the captain's chronometer.
</p>

<p>
All oblivious of the unhappy wretch who was
"chewing the cud of sweet and bitter fancy" aloft
in the fore-crosstrees (where the swaying of the mast
made the rolling of the ship seem so much greater
than below) jovial indeed was the party which
assembled at the sound of Joe's bell, and how
curly-headed Joe's honest English face shone as he handed
round coffee and tea, with whipped eggs for cream,
or as he skipped about with hot water, and handed
to the ladies preserves in tin cans, midshipmen's nuts
and American biscuits in a silver bread-barge, a
spotless white towel thrown over the sleeve of his round
jacket the while, for Joe was something of a hybrid,
half waiter and half seaman.
</p>

<p>
Under the cheering influence of Ethel's presence
Morley's features soon became less haggard, and the
keen, hawk-like expression of his dark eyes&mdash;an
expression the result of suffering, danger, and of being
long menaced by death&mdash;rapidly softened and passed
away.
</p>

<p>
But with breakfast untasted, or feigning only to
partake thereof, Ethel, pale and feverish, sat like
one in a dream.
</p>

<p>
For this sudden restoration of Morley to life and
to her, as it would seem from the bosom of the
deep&mdash;from the greedy waves of that vast ocean which
they had been traversing for more than three months&mdash;was
more difficult of realisation than the horror of
his disappearance and of his supposed dreadful
death.
</p>

<p>
But she, and Rose too, seemed so forgetful of
every one present, save Morley, that worthy young
Dr. Leslie Heriot, F.R.C.S.E., actually envied
him&mdash;envied the earlier intimacy he could claim with
these two charming sisters, and felt almost jealous
of the deep interest they evinced for our poor waif
of the sea.
</p>

<p>
"And so you are indeed Miss Ethel Basset?" said
Tom Bartelot, surveying the lovely girl with honest
admiration and kindliness, when he was introduced
to her.
</p>

<p>
"I am, sir," replied Ethel, smiling at his manner;
"and a very old friend of Mr. Ashton's."
</p>

<p>
"I can scarcely regret the loss of my ship, the
poor <i>Princess</i>" said Tom, gallantly, "or my own
suffering and misfortune, when I consider that all
have been but the means to a happy end."
</p>

<p>
"Sir?" said Ethel, blushing a little, and looking
down.  "You mean&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"That they have been the means of bringing you
and my old chum and schoolfellow, Mr. Ashton,
together again," continued Tom, blundering still more
by his straightforward inferences.
</p>

<p>
"You are very kind, sir, in saying so," replied
Ethel, as her colour came and went.
</p>

<p>
"That poor lad loves you as his very life,"
continued Tom, warming with his subject; "aye, far
beyond it, for, when compared with you, he don't
value it more than a bit of old rope-yarn!  Many
an hour has he walked the deck by my side,
speaking of you, and praising you; and even when
he didn't speak, by his silence and his sighs, I knew
well enough that he was thinking all the deeper."
</p>

<p>
"My poor Morley?" said Ethel, who heard all
this with joyous tears in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
As soon as they came on deck, Noah Gawthrop
presented himself in his peculiar attire, the black
dress-coat and crimson vest, and doffing his
sou'-wester at the break of the quarter-deck, twitched
his grizzled forelock, and beckoned Morley.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Ashton," said he, in a stage whisper,
"wot's this I hear forward among that rum lot in the
fok'stle?"
</p>

<p>
"Really, Noah, I cannot say.  What have you heard?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, sir, they says as your sweetheart, Miss
Basset&mdash;she you were always raving about on the
wreck&mdash;is aboard o' this here craft."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Noah, she is," replied Morley, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"Is that dainty little 'un her?"
</p>

<p>
"Which?"
</p>

<p>
"She with the pork-pie hat, red stockings, and
red cheeks, the jigamaree jacket, and crinnyline?"
said Noah.
</p>

<p>
"No; the taller lady."
</p>

<p>
"Smite my timbers!  A regular-built stunner!
Wot a wonderful coinsiddins!&mdash;wot a cannondrum! as
the player chaps say, when they go bouncing
about to the fiddles and blue fire!"
</p>

<p>
"It is destiny, Noah."
</p>

<p>
"Jest wot they says too!  Well, I have given
over sweethearting now; but I have shared my pay
with many o' that sort o' ware in my time.  The
best of 'em all&mdash;here's her photograff done in
gunpowder by the cook's mate of the <i>Haurora</i>, as we
were a working out of the harbour of Odessa.
Many a mouthful of salt-water I've swallowed, and
many a whistling Dick I've heard since that was
done," said Noah, pointing to the tattooing visible on
his breast when his check shirt was open.  "But
won't you introdooce me as an old shipmate?
'Mornin' marm, 'mornin'," he added, sweeping the
deck with his sou'-wester, as Ethel came frankly
forward; "I'm one o' them as took Mr. Ashton off
the cliffs, and sailed with him to Rio Janairey, in
South 'Meriky, in the old <i>Princess</i> as was."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed&mdash;oh, I am most happy to see you, sir," replied Ethel.
</p>

<p>
"Call me Noah, marm&mdash;Noah Gawthrop; I ain't
used to being sir'd," said he, smoothing down his gray hair.
</p>

<p>
"Well, my good friend Noah," said Ethel, her
eyes beaming, as she presented her little white hand
to Gawthrop, who looked at his own hard palm,
rubbed it well on his trousers as if to clean it, and
then shook hers gently and kindly, not crushing it
up as the tars do invariably in the play.
</p>

<p>
"Such a dear old thing it is!" said Rose,
laughing, as she observed this interview.
</p>

<p>
"I've made a man of him for you, Miss Ethel&mdash;I
knows your name, you see; one couldn't be long
with Mr. Ashton, keeping watch and watch, without
finding out that&mdash;but I have made a man of him for
you, marm.  He wasn't worth a tobacco-stopper at
first; but I've taught him to becket a royal, and
send it down, yard and all, in a stiff topgallant
breeze, or a regular squall; to slush a mast from
the truck-head downward; to haul out to leeward
when on the yard-arm, and if that ain't summut
towards making him a good husband for you, and
one as will, through the voyage of life, keep a firm
hand on your rudder, and trim you nicely by the
starn, I don't know wot is."
</p>

<p>
Noah's praises and rough congratulations were
unintelligible to Ethel; but as they were calculated
to excite laughter, and as some of his adjectives
applicable to the "shark up aloft in the fore-cross-trees"
were neither elegant nor euphonious, he was
speedily sent forward by Tom Bartelot.
</p>

<p>
Rose, perceiving that Ethel was deadly pale, for
the events of the morning proved rather too much
for her strength, took her below for a little time, by
Mr. Basset's suggestion.  Morley affectionately, and
tenderly handed her down the companion-stair&mdash;not
a glance of his the while, not an emotion or
movement being unnoticed by Hawkshaw, who, like a
hawk, or rather like a tree-tiger robbed of his prey,
was still perched alone in the fore-crosstrees.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX.
<br /><br />
THE CORPSE-LICHT.
</h3>

<p>
As Morley turned away from the companion, he was
confronted by his old friend Morrison, the mate of
the defunct <i>Princess</i>.  The Scotsman's honest face
was radiant with pleasure, and grasping Morley's
hand, he congratulated him warmly on the sudden
change that a few hours had made in all his plans
and prospects.
</p>

<p>
"No use in thinking of Tasmania now, or calculating
the chances of finding a ship for the Isle
of France, and all that, Mr. Ashton, eh?" said
Morrison, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"Thank Heaven, no," said Morley, as they
descended the break of the quarter-deck, and went to
windward, near the main-rigging; "so great has
been the alteration in all our affairs, that I can
scarcely believe I was the poor doomed wretch of a
few hours ago.  Another night on that wreck would
have seen us all dead men, Morrison."
</p>

<p>
Then Morley thought how strange it would have
been if the ship, with Ethel on board, had passed
the wreck, on board of which he was lying dead,
and there was no voice to inform them of his fate,
and the terrible mystery involving it.
</p>

<p>
"And you will be getting married now, Mr. Ashton,"
said Morrison, after a pause.
</p>

<p>
"Married!" repeated Morley, with astonishment;
"where&mdash;where&mdash;here upon the open sea?"
</p>

<p>
"No; but when we are all landed at the Mauritius,
where I shall have to look out for another ship, and,
perhaps, may have to work my way home before the
mast, for home to Scotland I must get somehow;
and before the mast&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You shall never go in that fashion, Morrison, if
I can help it; but as for my being married to Miss
Basset"&mdash;Morley felt his cheek flush and his heart
flutter at the thought&mdash;"that is an event which is
somewhat distant yet, and must be so, till
fortune&mdash;the old story&mdash;smiles on me."
</p>

<p>
"That I am sorry to hear," replied the Scotsman;
"what says poor Robbie Burns, in one of the
sweetest of his songs?&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'Oh, why should Fate sic pleasure have,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life's dearest bonds untwining?<br />
  And why sae sweet a flower as love<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depend on fortune's shining?'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Well, Mr. Ashton, hap what may, though our path
in life and our homes will aye be far apart, I'll never
forget the days we have spent together; and
miserable enough some of them have been latterly,"
continued Morrison, who was a warm-hearted and
impulsive fellow, and whose keen gray eyes grew
moist as he spoke; "and so, as I said, hap what
may, you shall always have the best wishes of poor
Bill Morrison, though a sailor has seldom more to
give, unless it be a quid from his tobacco-box, or a
share of his grog on pay-day."
</p>

<p>
"Fortune may go and hang herself," said Morley;
"she has never favoured me till now."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps she thought such a good-looking fellow
might be left to shift for himself," replied Morrison,
laughing.  "I once heard the song I have just
quoted sung by a girl, whose story was a very
strange one.  She was separated from her lover by
adverse circumstances, and though they never met
again in life, they repose now in the same grave."
</p>

<p>
"Another of your melancholy yarns, Bill?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, it isn't lively.  Shall I tell it to you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, please.  Miss Basset is still below."
</p>

<p>
"I had entered on board the <i>Clyde</i>, a Greenock
ship bound for Tasmania.  I was but a third mate
then, and that post, you know, is only a trifle better
than being before the mast.  She had several
emigrants, and among them was a man named Udny,
with his wife and a daughter whom I heard them
call Hester.
</p>

<p>
"There was with them a good-looking young
fellow from the shore, a shepherd apparently, for he
wore a checked tweed suit with a Border plaid, and
a broad blue bonnet.  He was evidently not going
the voyage; but he continued to hover about Hester
Udny with a sad and dreary expression of face, and
I could see that the girl's eyes were red and sore
with weeping.
</p>

<p>
"She was a bonnie, fair-haired Scotch lassie.
That the pair were lovers we could all see, and we
knew that they were about to be separated for
ever, perhaps, as her parents, poor and expatriated
cotters, were going to find a new home in Tasmania.
The lad was poorer still, and had to remain behind
in the old country.
</p>

<p>
"My heart bled for them, and from time to time
I could not restrain the inclination to observe them,
as they sat, hand in hand, oblivious of the noisy
throng about them, and the coarse jests of the
cargo-puddlers, dock-porters, and especially of the
sailors, each of whom volunteered to replace her
sweetheart on the voyage.
</p>

<p>
"Twilight came on as we began to cast off the
warps, and were towed down the river by a
tug-steamer, so quickly, that the lights of Greenock
soon twinkled out amid the haze and smoke astern.
</p>

<p>
"The sun had set, but the red flush of the
departed day lingered brightly beyond the dark peaks
of the Argyleshire mountains that look down on the
Gairloch, the Holy Loch, so solemn and still, and
many another place that I can see in memory
yet, and that I often saw in dreams when we were
floating on the wreck.
</p>

<p>
"The lad was to go back, among a few other
shore people, in the tug-steamer.  I heard the girl
sobbing as if her heart would break when she heard
the order given for them to quit the ship, as we
were preparing to cast off the towline and loosening
the topsails out of the bunt.  I was sent forward
with a gang to cat and fish the best bower anchor,
and hoist it over the bows on board.  When again
I went aft, sail had been made on the ship; the
tug-steamer had disappeared in the obscurity astern,
and the sad girl was sitting alone, with her eyes
fixed on the lights that glistened in the castle of
Dumbarton.
</p>

<p>
"We had been for some days at sea before the
girl came on deck.  She looked pale, wan, and
thin&mdash;worn almost to a shadow with mental suffering
and sea-sickness; and the close atmosphere of a
crowded steerage was as poison to one accustomed
from infancy to the green lanes and wooded hills of
Cydesdale.  All pitied her forlorn appearance, and
even the roughest sailor did not jest with her now.
</p>

<p>
"One evening she remained longer on deck than
usual.  I had the wheel; the ship was running
before the wind with topgallant-sails, lower and
topmast stun'sails set.  The air was mild and the
stars shone clearly and brightly amid amber to the
westward and the blue in the zenith.
</p>

<p>
"With her head muffled in a plaid, Hester Udny
was seated near me; but I had my attention mostly
fixed upon the binnacle.  There was silence fore and
aft, and silence on the sea, when I heard the poor
lassie singing to herself in a sweet, low voice, that
song of Burns', and the notes became full of pathos
fit the lines:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'Oh why should Fate sic pleasure have,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life's dearest bonds untwining?<br />
  And why sae sweet a flower as love<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depend on fortune's shining?'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Suddenly she uttered a cry, and springing to
me, grasped my arm.  Her plaid or shawl had fallen
back, and her fine golden-coloured hair was all in
disorder; her eyes, which were a deep blue, were
unnaturally bright and dilated, and their gaze was
fixed wildly upon a part of the deck just aft the
mainmast.
</p>

<p>
"'Sailor&mdash;sailor; oh, man, man, do you see that?'
she asked, in tones of terror.
</p>

<p>
"'What?' said I.
</p>

<p>
"'A flame rising up through the deck, and growing
higher every moment.'
</p>

<p>
"'Flame?' I repeated; 'there is no flame.'
</p>

<p>
"'Fire&mdash;it is not fire; it is the figure of a
man&mdash;head, shoulders, arms, and hands&mdash;flame, all flame,
pale blue, wavering, and indistinct!'
</p>

<p>
"'Nonsense, lassie, you are demented,' said I.
</p>

<p>
"'And you don't see it, sailor&mdash;you don't see
it?' she continued, wildly.
</p>

<p>
"'No, my poor lassie,' said I; 'your eyesight
must deceive you.'
</p>

<p>
"'Oh, heaven!' she shrieked, in a voice that
brought all who were below tumbling up the
hatches as if the ship were going down.  'Can I
be going mad?  It is like the figure of my Willie!'
</p>

<p>
"She fell senseless on the deck, and was carried
below.
</p>

<p>
"This alleged apparition caused great speculation,
and, as we had several emigrants from the Western
Highlands on board, no small degree of terror, so
that part of the deck abaft the mainmast was
always watched narrowly and suspiciously; but
neither flame nor figure saw we, though Hester
afterwards asserted that one of the watch, who
heard her cry, and hastened to assist her, passed
<i>through</i> the figure, which wavered as he did so, but
again resumed its luminous form.
</p>

<p>
"A fortnight elapsed before she was brought on
deck again; and I must own to being shocked at
the change in her appearance.  Her keen blue eyes
seemed unnaturally large and sunken, with dark
rings round them, and her poor, thin, transparent
hands trembled as she muffled her plaid or shawl
over her head, when the watch on deck hastened to
make a comfortable seat of old sails for her under
the lee of the bulwark.
</p>

<p>
"Fearing a repetition of what had occurred before,
her father and mother insisted on taking her below
when twilight approached; but, urged by some
undefinable feeling or emotion, she lingered longer
than she should have done.
</p>

<p>
"We were now in latitudes where the sun sets
quickly, the dusk comes on as rapidly, and heavily
falls the dew.
</p>

<p>
"Hester Udny, pale as a spectre, was soon observed
to fix her eyes upon that portion of the deck
abaft the mainmast where she had seen the apparition,
with a wild, but steady and deliberate gaze, as
if fascinated; and then, in faint and tremulous
accents, she declared that the figure of flame was
again visible, pale and luminous, sometimes turning
from amber to blue, and becoming hazy; that
beyond it, or through it, she could see the line of
the ship's bulwark, and the shrouds of the mainmast,
as if it was transparent.
</p>

<p>
"To undeceive her, the captain passed and repassed
the place, going each time, as she said, amid her
cries, completely through the figure, unsinged,
unhurt, and all unconscious that he was doing so.
</p>

<p>
"She swooned, and was carried below again.
</p>

<p>
"What added greatly to the strangeness of this
phenomenon was the circumstance that some of the
crew, when standing over the spot where the spectre
was alleged to appear, were seized with giddiness,
strange qualms, and even sickness, alike by day or
night, and were ridiculed by those of a less nervous
temperament, who never felt any such sensations, as
'green-horns' and 'fanciful lubbers.'
</p>

<p>
"Hester Udny never came on deck again&mdash;alive,
at least.
</p>

<p>
"She remained in bed during the remainder of
our voyage, evidently in a rapid decline, and on the
day when we made the south-west cape of Van
Diemen's Land&mdash;a high, bold, and rocky
promontory&mdash;she expired.
</p>

<p>
"We were soon within six miles of the land, and
her parents begged so hard that they might be
permitted to bury the poor girl ashore, that our skipper
acceded to their request.  Assisted by the sailmaker,
they wrapped her up in blankets, and her body was
placed on a grating along the thwarts of the
long-boat amidships, with a union-jack spread over it.
No other pall had we, nor could we have found a
better for a heart so true as that poor lassie once
possessed; and there she lay when we entered the
mouth of the Derwent river, and worked against a
head wind up D'Entrecasteaux's Channel.
</p>

<p>
"I see that I am tiring you, Morley, with this
long yarn; but Miss Basset is still below, and the
strangest part is yet to come.
</p>

<p>
"We got aground on the western side of the
channel, but ran an anchor out, manned the capstan,
and hove the ship off.  At half-past nine that night
we came to anchor in thirty-fathom water, off Hobart
Town, fired a gun, and furled our canvas, with the
ensign at our gaff-peak half hoisted, to show that
death had boarded us before the harpies of the
custom-house.
</p>

<p>
"By daybreak next day I was ordered with a gang
to prepare for breaking bulk, and proceeded to
unship the main-hatch prior to starting the cargo.
</p>

<p>
"On removing a bale or two, and a few casks, how
great was our horror to find, just abaft the
mainmast, and under that portion of the deck where
Hester Udny had twice seen the figure of flame&mdash;a
figure perhaps always there, though invisible to us&mdash;the
skeleton of a man, standing quite erect against
the after-bulkhead!
</p>

<p>
"He was dressed in a gray tweed suit, with a blue
bonnet, surmounted by a red tuft, and a checked
Border plaid was over his right shoulder.  All the
flesh had dried upon his bones, so that his clothes
hung loosely on him.  A few blackened shillings,
and a mouldy letter or two, were found in his pockets,
so we at once supposed that, being unable to pay
his passage, the poor fellow had secreted himself in
the hold, little knowing how the cargo would be
screwed and stowed up to the beams, and how
hermetically the hatches would be closed by battens,
tarpaulins, and iron bands; and thus he had perished
miserably, unheard, unseen, and unknown&mdash;perished
of suffocation, and remained there until he dried
into a veritable white mummy.
</p>

<p>
"Our commiseration was greatly increased when
we found that the mouldy green letters were written
by Hester Udny, and in the poor stowaway her
parents recognised her lover, Willie, the lad whom
we had all seen hovering about her on the night
we hauled out from Greenock to drop down the Clyde.
</p>

<p>
"They were buried ashore, these two ill-starred
and unfortunate lovers, in the burying-ground of
the big brick church of Hobart Town, and the
whole ship's company attended the funeral.  Jack's
a rough fellow, Mr. Ashton, but I can assure you
that, as we lowered their two plain black coffins into
their deep grave, side by side, with a few fathoms
of line, there was not a dry eye among us.
</p>

<p>
"And some of the roughest patted the old father
on the back, as he stood dreamily at the head of
his daughter's grave, in that far foreign land&mdash;sae
far frae the Hills o' Campsie, and wondering if
it could a' be true, and that she was lying there,
while tears streamed down his cheeks, and his
white hair waved i' the wind under his auld blue
bonnet."
</p>

<p>
It was a peculiarity of Morrison's, that whenever
he became interested, or perhaps more perfectly
natural, he always slid into his old Scottish
vernacular.
</p>

<p>
"This is a sad story, Morrison; but the luminous
figure which the girl saw&mdash;how the deuce do you
account for that?  She was out of her mind, of
course?"
</p>

<p>
"Out of her mind! not at all!" responded the
philosophical Scot; "she was of a delicate temperament,
and in a highly nervous and sensitive state,
thus she may or must have seen that which was
invisible to us of a rougher texture&mdash;the gaseous
light proceeding from the fermentation, putrescence,
and decay of the body beneath the deck&mdash;in short,
that which we call in Scotland a corpse-Kent." *
</p>

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
But now to return to our own story.
</p>

<p>
A long consultation ensued concerning what was
to be done with Cramply Hawkshaw, and the
conclusion come to was simply that he should be kept
in the seclusion, or "Coventry," enjoined by Captain
Phillips, till the vessel reached the Isle of France;
and Morley gave a species of parole, that he would
studiously avoid, nor seek in any way to punish him
for the outrage he had formerly committed, or that
which he had latterly attempted.
</p>

<p>
So the first day of Morley's re-union with his
friends passed merrily and happily away.
</p>

<p>
In honour of the event, Mr. Basset had a case
containing some of his favourite Marcobrumier and
sparkling hock hoisted out of the store-room, and in
the cabin that night the wine went round so freely,
that Captain Phillips's merry eyes shone in his head,
Tom Bartelot came out in his favourite drinking-song,
and poor Mr. Quail, all unused to such
beverages, when he went up to relieve the deck,
at eight bells, saw two wheels and two steersmen,
and the <i>Hermione</i>, tearing through the sea with six
masts, and at least seven-and-twenty crossyards
upon her.
</p>

<p>
As it came on to blow about midnight, a reef was
taken in the topsails, and forgetting the evil projects
broached by his crew on this occasion Captain
Phillips gave a double allowance of grog to the
watch, with pots of hot coffee to those who preferred
them&mdash;kindness thrown away, as it proved in the
sequel.
</p>

<p>
Now that our hero and heroine are safely re-united
on board the very ship in which they were originally
to have sailed together, the reader who is versed in
novel-lore may suppose that nothing remains but for
Mr. Basset to bestow his paternal benediction no
them in the true fashion of the "heavy father," and
for Hawkshaw, either at once to be forgiven, no
promising to be a good boy for the future, or to
receive condign punishment.
</p>

<p>
But, unfortunately, our story is not fictitious, so it
ends not here.
</p>

<p>
Morley has escaped death, and is again seated by
the side of Ethel Basset, gazing into her quiet, deep,
and loving eyes as if he could do so for ever, and
never, never weary, of course; but storms as yet
unthought of, unheard and unseen, are ahead.
</p>

<p>
The good ship <i>Hermione</i> lies bravely to her course,
now east and by north: but she carries with her the
growing elements of discord, crime, and misery.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><br />
OUT OF SCYLLA AND INTO CHARYBDIS.
</h3>

<p>
The little excitement consequent on discovering the
piece of wreck, the rescue of those who were on it,
and the speculation caused by the recent uproar in
the night, and the exclusion of Hawkshaw from the
cabin, soon passed over among the crew, who now
began to consider that there were on board four
more men to feed, to win over to the project of
Pedro Barradas&mdash;a process which seemed doubtful&mdash;or
to be got rid of, if the attempt to win them
failed.
</p>

<p>
The only one with whom they supposed there was
a chance of success was Noah Gawthrop, or "Old
Sticking-plaster," as they named him, from the
patch on his nose; and hence Badger, and one or
two others, were deputed to sound him on the subject;
but the chief defect in their plans arose from
a doubt of the ship's whereabouts, and whether
Captain Phillips would haul up for Table Bay.
</p>

<p>
Some were disposed to enlist Hawkshaw in their
daring scheme, or at least to sound him, too, as a
little homicide in no way injured a man in their
estimation; while the misery of Hawkshaw's
position on board might have made him ready to
embrace any proposition that came short of
jumping into the sea.
</p>

<p>
Neglected, to all appearance forgotten&mdash;for who
could sympathise with an assassin?&mdash;he had passed
the whole of the first day without food in the
fore-rigging.  Towards evening Quaco brought him a
pot of hot coffee from the galley, which was a
grateful beverage to his parched throat, and in the
twilight he came down stiff, sore, and benumbed,
and walked about amidships.
</p>

<p>
There, Joe, the steward, came to say, that when
he "wished to go below, his traps and berth were
'tween decks, where he would have full leisure to
employ his mind in squaring the circle."
</p>

<p>
At this jibe he clenched his hands to chastise Joe;
but felt too much crushed to make even the attempt,
and turned in silence away.
</p>

<p>
On the second or third day after his expulsion
from the cabin, when retiring to his place between
decks&mdash;the same quarter in which the four
hammocks had been hung&mdash;he encountered Miss Basset,
and passed her so closely that he felt her skirts
brush against him.
</p>

<p>
Though dark and soft, Ethel's eyes were at times
keen and piercing, for they possessed a wonderful
power and beauty of expression&mdash;a beauty one may
meet with perhaps but once in a lifetime.  As she
passed Hawkshaw, she drew aside her skirt, as if to
avoid contact, and hastily cast down her eyes, as if
loath to humiliate him, while her breast heaved, and
her cheek grew painfully pale; but in her eyes, as
they flashed beneath their downcast lashes,
Hawkshaw could see the horror, the loathing, and
even terror with which his presence inspired her.
</p>

<p>
More humbled than ever by this, though he
could have expected nothing else, he slunk to his
place of penance&mdash;his prison he deemed it, as he
seldom left it&mdash;and casting himself upon the
sea-chest, groaned aloud in rage, in bitterness, and
agony of spirit.
</p>

<p>
His food was brought to him by Quaco, the black
cook; but his appetite was gone, so each meal was
taken away almost untasted.
</p>

<p>
"By golly, Massa Hawkshaw, you had better eat
and keep strong," said Quaco, with a grin on his
shining face.
</p>

<p>
"Why&mdash;what the devil is it to you whether I
eat or not, you black thief?" asked Hawkshaw,
savagely.
</p>

<p>
"Kindness, on'y kindness, massa&mdash;yaas, yaas,"
he replied, grinning more broadly than ever.
</p>

<p>
"I want none, even from you."
</p>

<p>
"Dat be bad&mdash;dat is; but, golly! don't you
know what Pedro Barradas am up to?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"He's agoin' to be massa capting."
</p>

<p>
"What?"
</p>

<p>
"He's agoin' to trim de ship by de starn, he is.
Jolly, ain't it!  But there will be no loblolly boys
allowed to skulk 'tween decks arter dat&mdash;by golly! no,"
and, grinning away like an ogre, with his
yellow eyeballs gleaming, his white teeth and
angular cheek-bones shining, Quaco retired with the
greasy wooden mess-kid on which he had brought
Hawkshaw some hot lobscouse.
</p>

<p>
Quaco's words made his heart beat faster, and
set him to think deeply, and with indescribable
agitation.
</p>

<p>
The proposed seizure of the ship was again upon
the <i>tapis</i>.
</p>

<p>
Should he acquaint Captain Phillips of it; but
perhaps he knew of it already more fully, and was
quite prepared.
</p>

<p>
By his silence, Ethel might be destroyed; by
speaking in time, she might be saved; but only
saved for Morley Ashton.  Damning thought!  The
first impulse made him start to his feet, to summon
Joe; the second made him sink back sullenly on the
sea-chest again.
</p>

<p>
To join those in the cabin was but to serve
Morley Ashton and those who loathed him; to
league with the mutineers, whom he dreaded, was
but to sink deeper in disgrace and more hopelessly
into crime.
</p>

<p>
On shore, he would have gladly fled from them
all; but in that floating prison, the <i>Hermione</i>, he
had but one resource left&mdash;to join the crew&mdash;if he
would save his own life.  He felt himself helplessly
at the mercy of the Barradas; and, by joining them
in the scuffle or conflict that must precede the
capture of the ship, he might find a fair means of
putting a period to Morley Ashton's existence, if
some one else did not anticipate him.  Morley he
hated with a tiger-like emotion&mdash;a mingled dread
and aversion.
</p>

<p>
For himself, he might yet have Ethel in his
power.  Some very daring, dark, and incoherent
thoughts flashed through his mind.  He might have
her, in spite of Fate and Fortune, too; and
afterwards, when once on shore, she would feel herself
compelled to link her future life with his.
</p>

<p>
The shore&mdash;any shore&mdash;oh, how he longed for it.
</p>

<p>
He felt himself constrained to avoid the deck,
save in the night, and thus to spend the entire day
below.
</p>

<p>
Secluded there like a felon, avoided like a reptile,
he asked himself, was he really the man of yesterday
or the day before?&mdash;the same Cramply Hawkshaw
who had sat at table with the Bassets and
officers of the ship, enjoying their society and
companionship, as an equal and friend?
</p>

<p>
Was the past, indeed, gone for ever?  He was on
board the same ship (how he loathed and cursed
every rope in her rigging, every plank in her hull);
he still heard the same daily sounds on deck, the
same voices from time to time, and more than once
he had heard Rose Basset's ringing laugh; there
was the same rush of water alongside; the same
moaning of the wind aloft; the same bell clanging
the half hours; all seemed unchanged but he alone!
</p>

<p>
He could not bring back the perfect idea of
himself, or what he was.
</p>

<p>
How bitterly he felt, how impatiently he spurned
the restraint imposed upon him in the circumscribed
space of the ship, and longed for land, any land, as
we have said&mdash;Africa, even Dahomey, were welcome&mdash;that
he might escape and hide himself from all;
but chiefly from the Bassets, before whom he had
so successfully glozed over his secret life and real
character by a network of lies, crimes, and
cunning&mdash;a network which Morley's sudden appearance had
torn aside.
</p>

<p>
Right well he knew the light in which all viewed
him now&mdash;a swindler, impostor, and worse.
</p>

<p>
Unless it lingered in the emotions of envy and
wounded self-esteem, his selfish passion for Ethel
had quite evaporated, amid his shame and humiliation,
or was almost merged in his vengeful hate of
Morley&mdash;a sentiment rendered all the deeper by the
wrongs already attempted without success.
</p>

<p>
So there, between decks, in the scene of his last
attempted crime, he sat and brooded darkly on the
past, or scheming out the future; a trial he did not
dread, even if the vessel reached the Isle of France,
and Morley Ashton urged it by an appeal to the
civil authorities.
</p>

<p>
There would be but his bare accusation, without
a single witness to support it, so a bare denial was
all that was necessary, for well he knew that no
human eye had seen that encounter by the verge of
Acton Chine, in England.
</p>

<p>
Then there was a memory of Ethel's loathing
attitude and averted glance lingering like a barbed
arrow in his heart.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said he, aloud, "I feel the time at hand
when I may requite hate with deeper hate."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Buenos noches, mi hombre de nada</i>," ("Good
night, my rascal, or man of nothing") said a voice
in his ear, and, starting from his reverie, he found
himself confronted by the tall and muscular figure
of Pedro Barradas.
</p>

<p>
It was night now, and the candle flickered
dimly in the lantern of perforated tin, which swung
from a beam above, and its downward rays fell on
the dark face and picturesque figure of the South
American seaman, with his crisp locks and
coal-black beard, his tawny ears, in each of which a
silver ring was glittering, his loose shirt of dark
blue woollen, open at his breast, on which a cross
was tattooed, and girt at the waist by a Spanish
scarlet sash, in which his Albacete knife was stuck.
</p>

<p>
A fierce and malicious grin pervaded his sombre
features&mdash;such a grin as one might imagine in the
face of a laughing fiend&mdash;as he surveyed the crushed
and miserable Hawkshaw, who, being quite
unarmed, was not without emotions of terror and
alarm.
</p>

<p>
"You scurvy <i>ladrone</i>," said Pedro, grinding his
strong white teeth, "when I remember that
evening in the Barranca Secca, between Xalappa and
the Puebla de Perote, and the use you made of your
lasso, I wonder what devil prevents me from
putting my knife into you."
</p>

<p>
Hawkshaw started back, and glanced hopelessly
about for a weapon.  Pedro laughed hoarsely; but
his merriment did not allay the alarm of
Hawkshaw, who knew that such men as he could jest
with their victim while the knife was piercing his
heart.
</p>

<p>
"So the air of the cabin has not agreed with you,
eh?  Well, I daresay you have been worse lodged
and fixed in Texas, where some of the huts are no
better than a <i>retranche</i>; but I think you had better
come forward and hitch in with us."
</p>

<p>
Hawkshaw still glanced uneasily about him.
</p>

<p>
"Demonio! why don't you speak, and be d&mdash;&mdash;d
to you?" roared Pedro, losing his patience, which
was never at any time a very extensive commodity.
"Have you lost your lying tongue as well as your
wits?"
</p>

<p>
"No, Pedro Barradas, I have lost neither."
</p>

<p>
"How long it is since I have heard my name on
your tongue, <i>companero</i>; not since we were diggers
together on the banks of the Feather River.  Speak
out&mdash;<i>presto</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"What do you want with me, or require of me?"
</p>

<p>
"I am exceedingly anxious to ascertain something
of which the crew have been kept in ignorance
for some time past."
</p>

<p>
"Something&mdash;from me?" asked Hawkshaw,
with surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"You mean the progress and working of the
vessel?"
</p>

<p>
"Precisely so; her whereabouts upon the sea."
</p>

<p>
"How should I know?"
</p>

<p>
"How you should or should not is nothing to
me; but, <i>presto</i>, no equivocation," said Pedro,
placing his right hand on the haft of his knife.
</p>

<p>
"Then, for the soul of me, I cannot tell you,"
replied Hawkshaw, with great earnestness.
</p>

<p>
"You must have heard it mentioned, casually or
otherwise, in the cabin.  The latitude and longitude,
I mean."
</p>

<p>
"If so, may I die if I can remember them now."
</p>

<p>
Pedro's eyes began to gleam dangerously; but
he changed his tactics, and asked:
</p>

<p>
"What does the captain mean to do with you?"
</p>

<p>
"Do with me?" stammered Hawkshaw.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, <i>santos</i>!  I spoke plain enough."
</p>

<p>
"But I do not understand," said Hawkshaw,
evasively.
</p>

<p>
"Must I speak more plainly?"
</p>

<p>
"If you please."
</p>

<p>
"How cursedly polite we are," sneered Pedro.
"Well, most illustrious Senor Caballero, does he
mean to maroon you, or hang you?"
</p>

<p>
"Neither; and in either case it is not probable
he would consult you."
</p>

<p>
"Well, <i>companero</i>, perhaps he will land you at
El Cabo de Bueno Esparanza?" said Pedro, with
more suavity.
</p>

<p>
"We are not to touch at the Cape," was the
unwary reply.
</p>

<p>
"Not to touch at the Cape?" repeated Pedro, so
loudly that he might have been heard in the
cabin.
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Why."
</p>

<p>
"Simply because I have been given to understand
that we are past it."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Por vida del demonio</i>!  Past it, say you?"
exclaimed Pedro, as if communing with himself.
</p>

<p>
"One thing, at least, is certain.  We are not, I
am sorry to say, to touch at the Cape."
</p>

<p>
"And who told you this?"
</p>

<p>
"The captain himself."
</p>

<p>
Pedro uttered a tremendous Spanish oath,
expressive of extreme astonishment and satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
"So&mdash;so this cunning old Englander has been
keeping us all in the dark as to where we are?"
</p>

<p>
"Exactly."
</p>

<p>
"But wherefore?"
</p>

<p>
"That I cannot say," said Hawkshaw, evasively.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Morte de Dios</i>! does he suspect?&mdash;does he smell
at a rat!" exclaimed the Spaniard, with a sudden
rage; but Hawkshaw remained silent.  "We must
be somewhere off the coast of La Tierra de Natal,
and if so, by the ship's steering to-day, the mouth
of the Mozambique Channel should be upon our
weather-bow; yet how far distant, none but the
captain and his mates can say," continued Pedro,
as if in communion with himself; but he was wrong
in his supposition, for the ship, at the time he
spoke, was about a hundred miles to the southward
of Algoa Bay, which opens between Cape Recife
and Cape Padrone in southern Africa.
</p>

<p>
"Listen to me," said Pedro, suddenly, with a
savage glare in his black eyes, a low and husky
tone in his deep, sonorous voice, his right hand on
the haft of his knife, and his left planted on
Hawkshaw's shoulder with the grasp of a vice.  "We
mean to take this ship, and run her on our own
account; but as four new hands have been added
to the officers, will you join us?  It is a fair
offer&mdash;your only chance of vengeance, too: for, ashore,
you will not be worth a rotten castano."
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;well&mdash;I am with you," said Hawkshaw,
in a low and husky voice.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Bueno!</i> we should fight for the ship whether
you were with us or not.  Your hand on it, mate!
But first, what terms do you want?"
</p>

<p>
"My life, in the first place, to be respected by
all, and to be set ashore on the first land we see, as
I am not a seaman."
</p>

<p>
"The <i>first</i> land may be a sea-weedy rock, at the
mouth of the Mozambique," said Pedro, with a
diabolical grin, as it suggested a new idea of cruelty.
"Your share of plunder?"
</p>

<p>
"I seek no plunder.  I seek but revenge and
liberty."
</p>

<p>
"Your hand, then; and let us forget all about
the Barranca Secca."
</p>

<p>
Pedro grasped in his strong, hard hand the
shrinking fingers of Hawkshaw, thinking the while;
</p>

<p>
"This ship once ours, I shall soon make short
work of it with <i>you</i>, my fine fellow!"  Grinding
his teeth, he added aloud, "If you betray us, woe
to you."
</p>

<p>
"I am pledged," said Hawkshaw, in a voice like
a groan.
</p>

<p>
"The cargo is valuable, so we shall go in for a
good stroke of business together."
</p>

<p>
"When&mdash;when do you make the attempt?"
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow night, or the next, at latest."
</p>

<p>
"I shall be ready."
</p>

<p>
"Then to-morrow evening at four bells, in the
second dog-watch, be in the forecastle bunks, and
you will learn all.  Till then, companero, be silent,
and <i>remember</i>!"
</p>

<p>
With another significant touch of his knife-handle,
Pedro retired, leaving Hawkshaw in a very
unenviable state of mind.  As a bold and reckless
ruffian, the Spanish American valued him little as
an ally; but the chief object of his visit had been
attained&mdash;information that the ship, instead of being
hauled up for Table Bay, was <i>past</i> it.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><br />
FOUR BELLS IN THE DOG-WATCH.
</h3>

<p>
All the next day there blew a gale, and Captain
Phillips, anxious to make the most of it, as the
wind was fair, squared his yards, with all that he
dared to spread upon them.  So sharp was the
aforesaid gale, that on a taut bowline, no vessel could
have shown more than a single sail, perhaps; but
the <i>Hermione</i> tore on before the hurrying blast,
with her fore and main courses bellying out before
it, and her three topsails set with a single reef in
each.
</p>

<p>
Ere long, Captain Phillips was heard to shout:
</p>

<p>
"Away aloft, men&mdash;shake the reefs out of the
topsails&mdash;masthead the yards."
</p>

<p>
Cheerfully enough the watch sprang aloft and
obeyed the order.  And now the foam flew in white
sheets over her sharp bows, rolling aft to the break
of the quarter-deck, from whence it surged forward
again, and gurgled through the scuppers on each
side alternately.
</p>

<p>
Astern a tremendous sea kept rolling after her,
for waves and wind and all were with her now, and
she sped before them at the rate of eleven knots an
hour; thus it required all the strength of Pedro
Barradas and of Noah Gawthrop, who volunteered
for it, to hold the wheel, and steer her steadily.
</p>

<p>
Inspirited by the speed with which his brave ship
tore along through foam and spray, Captain Phillips
walked briskly to and fro, with his hands thrust
into the pockets of his glazed storm-jacket, a
gutta-percha speaking-trumpet under one arm, and his
jolly red face shining with pleasure and drops of
spray, as he glanced alternately aloft, over the
quarter, or at Mr. Quail, who smiled approvingly.
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah, old ship!" said he; "now she goes
through it! now she walks along with a will.  She
smells the Mauritius already, I think."
</p>

<p>
"The Bird Islands, or the Mozambique, more
likely," muttered Pedro to Noah.
</p>

<p>
"What the devil have we to do with either one
or the other?" asked Noah, with sulky suspicion.
</p>

<p>
"There she goes!" continued the captain; "and
on she shall crack as long as her sticks hold
together.  Mr. Quail, get preventer-braces reeved;
ship tackles on the backstays, haul all taut, and
belay."
</p>

<p>
All day the gale held on thus, and about nightfall,
when it began to abate into a steady breeze, in
which the swinging booms of the lower studding-sails
dipped at times like birds' wings in the brine,
the <i>Hermione</i> must have run more than 120 miles,
and she was about that distance off the most
southern portion of the coast of Natal.
</p>

<p>
How often had Captain Phillips and Mr. Basset
wished to be fairly round the Cape of Good Hope&mdash;to
have doubled it, though it was far away from
dear old England; yet it was a necessary feature or
point to be achieved in the voyage.  They were
fairly round the great Cape of Storms now, and
the vessel's course was east and northerly, with a
calm sea and a fair wind.
</p>

<p>
Every one should have been in the highest spirits;
but, save Ethel and Rose, Morley and his three
companions, all were cloudy, anxious, and dull; for
Captain Phillips, his officers, and Mr. Basset felt
themselves still menaced by secret dangers.
</p>

<p>
During the most of this day Morley had remained
below with Ethel.  Rose was working beads on a
cigar-case for the doctor, and Tom Bartelot, with
Morrison, remained by choice on deck.
</p>

<p>
"Now that we can be of service, Captain Phillips,"
said Tom, "we must be allowed to take our turn of
duty.  I know that sick folks are soon deemed little
better than skulkers aboard ship."
</p>

<p>
"How so?"
</p>

<p>
"When one has to take a fellow's trick at the
helm, another his look-out aloft, or out upon the
booms, a third his watch, and a fourth something
else, they soon weary of him."
</p>

<p>
"True," replied Captain Phillips, in a low voice,
as they drew near the break of the deck, and beyond
ear-shot of that tall son of Columbia, Mr. William
Badger, who was at the wheel, with his very long
legs, half-cased in very short trousers, placed very
far apart; "but your arrival on board, if a lucky
circumstance for you all, has been rather a godsend
to me."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!  How?  The ship doesn't look short-handed."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! here comes Mr. Ashton; and please call
your mate here.  I have something to say to you all."
</p>

<p>
Tom beckoned Morrison, who had been busy
coiling and belaying some of the running rigging,
for the crew had become exceedingly untidy and
neglectful.
</p>

<p>
Badger's keen eyes peered from under his beetling
brows, as if he strove to see, what he could not
overhear, the conversation that ensued, when Captain
Phillips detailed the secret state of his crew, and the
daring project which the doctor had heard so freely
canvassed in the forecastle.
</p>

<p>
Bartelot and Morrison heard the honest captain's
narrative with astonishment and indignation, but
Morley with a terror and agony very much akin to
Mr. Basset's, under the same circumstances.
</p>

<p>
"In such a state of matters, why did you not haul
up for Table Bay, where some ships of war are sure
to be?" asked Bartelot.
</p>

<p>
"Such was my intention; but the same hurricane
that destroyed your ship drove mine too far to the
southward.  That circumstance made us the means
of saving you; but I lost thereby a chance of
thinning out, or altogether dispersing the crew, and
shipping another."
</p>

<p>
"Aye, aye," observed Morrison; "what between
crews of Lascars and coloured men, Chinese junks
and piratical Bornese boats, there are many craft
disappear in these seas, and at Lloyd's the typhoons
are held responsible for all."
</p>

<p>
"If that fellow who is at the wheel, and two who
are named Barradas, were quietly overboard, I could
manage the rest, I think."
</p>

<p>
"Barradas! are they Spaniards?" asked Tom.
</p>

<p>
"Spanish South Americans&mdash;two of that bad lot
who are so often to be seen loafing about the
Liverpool docks."
</p>

<p>
"Troublesome hands always."
</p>

<p>
"And these two are among the worst&mdash;the very
worst.  They were chums of that fellow Hawkshaw
in Texas and Mexico, at the gold diggings, and
elsewhere, it would appear.  They are two brothers,
named Pedro and Zuares&mdash;at heart, pirates
both."
</p>

<p>
"Barradas!" said Morley, striving to remember;
"that name seems familiar to me."
</p>

<p>
"Have you forgotten the name of the old
hermit&mdash;the 'darvish,' as Noah called him&mdash;whom we
buried on the island, and whose papers I read to
you?" asked Morrison.
</p>

<p>
"Don Pedro Zuares de Barradas," said Bartelot.
</p>

<p>
"I remember now.  I have his Spanish cross
below," said Morley.  "Good Heavens! if these
should be his sons!  The names are the same.  How
singular!"
</p>

<p>
"And they were comrades of Hawkshaw, you
say, Captain Phillips?"
</p>

<p>
"Comrades, or shipmates, or something&mdash;nothing
good, you may be assured."
</p>

<p>
And now Morley, just as Dr. Heriot joined them,
recalled Hawkshaw's strange story of how the one
named Zuares committed&mdash;unwittingly, however&mdash;the
awful crime of matricide, in the Barranca
Secca&mdash;that savage story which he related on a summer
evening in Acton Chase, to the Bassets and Pages;
and now, by a strange fatality, their lot was all cast
together within the narrow compass of a single ship,
upon the wide and lonely sea.
</p>

<p>
"These are most calamitous tidings," said Morley,
in a low and troubled voice, as he passed his arm
through Heriot's, and drew him aside; "love, they
say, laughs at danger; but here, Dr. Heriot, love
may weep," he added, almost with a groan.
</p>

<p>
"Hang it, man, call me Heriot&mdash;Leslie Heriot, or
whatever you like; but drop the doctor, it sounds so
precious stiff, especially when&mdash;when we both love
these two girls."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Morley, who, as an Englishman, had
his local or national prejudices, but meant to be
complimentary, "for a Scotchman, you are a nice
fellow, Heriot; but&mdash;but Ethel and Rose, what are
we to do now?"
</p>

<p>
"Fight to the last gasp for them, that is all,"
replied Heriot, stoutly.
</p>

<p>
While they were conversing thus, Noah Gawthrop
approached Captain Bartelot, and, in his own
fashion, began to state that he had heard some
strange hints dropped by the watch at night, by
others that lounged about the windlass-bitts and
forecastle; that some of the crew had been
whetting their knives on the carpenter's grindstone,
that all were on the alert, and were, he added,
"sartainly up to summut that looked like squalls, or
mischief."
</p>

<p>
As an old man-o'-war's man, Noah knew well
how unpleasant was the reputation of being a
tale-bearer, and that, if it was bad ashore, it was
deemed ten times worse at sea; but in the <i>Aurora</i>
he had acquired certain ideas of discipline which
had never left him, so he considered that he was
only doing his duty in this matter.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean to do, your honour?" he
asked of Captain Phillips, in a husky whisper.
</p>

<p>
Phillips gave him a grim smile, and showed the
butt of a revolver in his breast-pocket.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, the poor girls below," said Morley.
</p>

<p>
"I have perilled my life many times, young
gentleman," said Phillips&mdash;"many times on land, but
oftener still on the great highway of waters, and,
though scared a bit, I ain't going to be frightened
now; and, believe me, my ship shall not be taken
without a scrimmage.  Let these mutinous curs
come on and do their worst, I'm ready for
them&mdash;life for life, and man to man."
</p>

<p>
"Hooray, and the <i>Haurora</i> for ever.  Beat to
quarters&mdash;them's my sentiments," said Noah, with
a voice so loud that long Badger, at the wheel,
craned his scraggy neck to listen, and opened his
eyes and ears very wide indeed.  "D&mdash;&mdash;n their
limbs!  I hopes to see 'em all with their ears nailed
to the mainmast, and here's the fist as will handle
the hammer and nails."
</p>

<p>
As he made this unwise exclamation, he stepped
aft, to relieve Badger at the wheel, and that
ungainly personage, avoiding the group who were at
the gangway, passed forward to the forecastle,
where he at once informed his colleagues that he
"rayther reckoned that old man-o'-war shark had
blowed the whole affair upon them."
</p>

<p>
Deeply-muttered oaths and vows of vengeance on
poor old Noah were the immediate result.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Por mi honor!</i>" exclaimed Pedro, who was
polishing the blade of his knife on the sole of his
shoe; "so, so, this is what old sticking-plaster is up
to&mdash;eh?"
</p>

<p>
"In course, my Spanish gamecock."
</p>

<p>
"<i>El espio y picaro!</i> (spy and scoundrel)," said
Pedro, grinding his teeth.
</p>

<p>
"The old corksucker!" growled the rest, using
in this the most opprobrious epithet known at
sea.
</p>

<p>
"He's a old man-o'-war's man, and, I reckon, has
got notions o' discipline, doffing his hat to the
quarter-deck, and other darned nonsense whipped
into him, nigger fashion, by the boatswain's cat.
To try gettin' over such fellows is summut like
reefing of a stun'sail, or anythin' else that's next to
useless."
</p>

<p>
Having delivered himself of this aphorism,
Badger proceeded to "darn" sundry parts of
Noah's person, such as his eyes and limbs, and by
the unanimous vote of all he was consigned to very
warm latitudes indeed.
</p>

<p>
Amid this, the ship's bell struck.  It was the
appointed time&mdash;four bells in the second
dog-watch&mdash;and then, pale as a spectre, or looking like
an evil spirit whom the sound had summoned&mdash;Cramply
Hawkshaw descended through the scuttle
into the little apartment, or fore-cabin, a close and
squalid den, where his appearance was greeted with
shouts of ironical welcome and applause, in which
the watch on deck joined.
</p>

<p>
We have already detailed a scene in this unpleasant
quarter of the ship; but have little desire
to rehearse another, and so shall be brief.
</p>

<p>
With a mocking grimace on his moustached lip,
and a ferocious gleam in his wild black eyes, Pedro
presented Hawkshaw to the crew as a new <i>companero
amigo</i>&mdash;associate and friend.
</p>

<p>
"Hitch in, mates&mdash;make room for the capting,"
said Badger, drawing in his long, lean, and
misshapen legs.  "So having 'ad a spell in limbo aft,
you're bound for the bunks forward, eh?  Come,
Pedro, prodooce the dev'l's bones&mdash;let him have a
shy with the ivories.  I reckon he's got an eye on
the gals aft, as well as ourselves; and I say,
capting&mdash;Jeerusalem! ain't the black eyes o' that oldest
gal regular Broadway shiners!"
</p>

<p>
In his misery and rage, Hawkshaw had slunk
forward, and joined the crew with two ideas
uppermost in his mind: that he would yet revenge
himself on Morley Ashton, and might also have the
haughty Ethel at his mercy&mdash;that she yet might be
his, and his only, despite fate, fortune, and friends,
and despite her own aversion for him.
</p>

<p>
But when he found himself among this crew of
desperadoes, whose obscene lips bandied about the
names of those so pure and gentle, fair and tender,
as Ethel and Rose Basset, the old times of Laurel
Lodge came to memory, and though bad, hardened,
and desperate, Hawkshaw felt his soul die within
him.
</p>

<p>
But it was too late for receding now!
</p>

<p>
Criminal though he was, to find himself the chosen
comrade and companion of these wretches, filled up
the full measure of his misery; but no sympathy can
be wasted on him, when we remember the crimes of
which he had been guilty, and the keen suffering he
had caused to Ethel, to Morley, and to others.
</p>

<p>
In mockery, and in a pretended spirit of good
fellowship, Pedro's loaded <i>dados</i> were produced from
his sea-chest, and they proceeded again to cast lots
for wives among the women in the cabin, amid
roars of laughter, cheers, and other noises, while, to
enhance the general din, Mr. Badger smashed the
mess-beef kid, dashed the butter gallipot to pieces,
and danced a hornpipe on the tin bread-barge.
</p>

<p>
This noisy laughter was heard distinctly in the
cabin.
</p>

<p>
"Surely that sounds jolly and well," said Tom
Bartelot, as the party from the deck entered it;
"fellows who laugh so loudly cannot mean much
mischief."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, you don't know them," said Captain Phillips,
in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
"Mischief?" said Ethel, looking up inquiringly.
</p>

<p>
"What, is it possible that you don't know?"
Morley was beginning, when Mr. Basset placed a
finger on his lip warningly.
</p>

<p>
Those extremely hilarious sounds in the forepart
of the ship were simply caused by the lots for
sweethearts or wives being cast anew.
</p>

<p>
Ethel had fallen to Pedro Barradas, thanks to his
peculiarly-constructed dice; Rose fell to the share
of Bill Badger; and Nance Folgate, the old nurse,
to Hawkshaw; and hence the yells and screams of
laughter that ascended from the fore-scuttle, and
rang upon the still and starlight night.
</p>

<p><a id="chap23"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII.
<br /><br />
THE CRISIS AT LAST.
</h3>

<p>
On the morrow, a gale like that we have described
carried the ship still farther on her course; but
again, towards evening, the sea and wind went
down together, and a calm and lovely night stole
over the world of waters.
</p>

<p>
Morley had intended to speak to the two Barradas
about what he suspected&mdash;his knowledge of their
secret history.  Had he found an opportunity for
doing so, much evil would, perhaps, have been
averted, as he might have exercised a little influence
over them; but one time they were aloft in the
rigging, at another, tarring down the backstays,
clapping on chafing gear, or otherwise occupied most
of the day, as they now began to feel a <i>personal
interest</i> in the ship; so no opportunity occurred, and
the fatal evening of the intended mutiny crept on.
</p>

<p>
And, notwithstanding that he was a quiet and
peaceable man, and possessed of much of the caution
usually attributed to his countrymen, matters were
precipitately brought to a crisis by Morrison, Tom
Bartelot's Scotch mate, as we shall soon have
occasion to show.
</p>

<p>
On this night our old friend was at the wheel, as
a volunteer; and, as the atmosphere was singularly
calm, Morley and Ethel, Rose and Heriot, were on
deck, sometimes seated in pairs, conversing in low
and confidential tones, or promenading, arm-in-arm,
between the break of the deck and the taffrail.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Basset and the captain were smoking near the
companion-hatch, Mr. Quail had turned in below,
and the second mate, Foster, had charge of the
ship, whose lofty spread of snow-white canvas
shimmered with a weird effect in the light of the
rising moon, which heaved up at the horizon, the
size of three European moons&mdash;sublime and vast&mdash;to
shed a blaze of silver radiance far across the sea.
</p>

<p>
Noah's hints had already made Captain Phillips
take in his studding-sails and royals, so the ship was
now running snugly and easily, under the fore and
main-course, topgallant-sails, jib and spanker.
</p>

<p>
Ethel sat silently, with her hands clasped on
Morley's left arm, for the moonlight on the water,
the stars above, and his familiar voice, made her
think of home, and the beautiful garden at Laurel
Lodge, with its ribbon-borders of pinks, mignonette,
and scarlet geraniums; its roseries, its gigantic
sweet peas, her sister's boasted azaleas, which
Hawkshaw had ridiculed in an evil hour; its avenues of
laurels and stately old sycamores.
</p>

<p>
She now drew forth her mother's miniature, which
she wore in her breast, at the end of a slender gold
chain.  It had been taken in that dear mother's
youth, when she closely resembled Ethel herself.
</p>

<p>
Who that surveyed that soft, bright, smiling face,
could realise the idea that it was the image of one
who had long been dead, and had passed away.
</p>

<p>
So, as Ethel gazed upon it, her mother's figure,
expression of face, and tone of voice, the embodiment
of that gentle friend and loving mentor, all a
mother should be, "the best and most beautiful of
earth's creatures," rose to memory, strangely mingled
with recollections of her death and of her funeral,
on a sunny day, in peaceful Acton churchyard, while
the familiar bell tolled solemnly in the old grey
Norman tower, and when the turf looked so green,
the fresh earth so brown, and that awful and
mysterious grave, as it yawned beneath the old yew
tree, so deep, so terrible!
</p>

<p>
Then there was the reverend rector, her father's
dearest friend, reading the beautiful and impressive
service for the faithful departed, while his voice
faltered and his eyes glistened.  It was the last day
of an English autumn, when the leaves of the tall
oaks in the Chase, and the foliage of every coppice,
were brown and crisp, and when all the world
seemed hushed and still; when even the village
urchins who clambered on the churchyard wall were
mute, and sat uncovered, and no sound stirred the
air but the rector's voice, and the solemn bell that
boomed in the time-worn tower, and shook its ivy
leaves.
</p>

<p>
So all that sad and mournful day came vividly
back and unbidden to memory now.
</p>

<p>
"Mamma, dear, dear mamma! she did so love
you, Morley!" said Ethel, as she closed the
miniature, and placed it tenderly in her bosom.
</p>

<p>
Inspired by livelier thoughts on the other side of
the quarter-deck, merry Rose Basset and the doctor
were leaning over the bulwarks, and watching the
luminous animacula that gleamed in the passing
waves.
</p>

<p>
In the second chapter of our history, we have
related how Mr. Basset had considered the early
engagement between Morley Ashton and Ethel
the mere fancy of a boy and girl&mdash;a fancy which
separation, or the spirit of change, might cause to
wear away and be forgotten.
</p>

<p>
But now, by his most providential restoration,
by the strength of their mutual regard, by what the
poor fellow had undergone; by what Ethel, too, had
suffered, and, more than all, by the necessity for
securing her future happiness, he felt himself bound
to do the utmost in his power to advance Morley's
interests, when they all reached their new home in
the Mauritius, and a reiterated promise to this effect
had made the young pair supremely happy.
</p>

<p>
Rose and the doctor were the next consideration;
what was to be done with them?
</p>

<p>
The excitement consequent to recent events; the
expected outbreak among the crew; the discovery
of the wreck, its occupants, and their story,
together with Hawkshaw's villainy, had so fully
occupied the attention of all on board, that Heriot
had scarcely found an opportunity for broaching a
matter, which Captain Phillips's jokes had quite
prepared our friend, the judge, to have laid before him,
for his earnest consideration and kindly
sympathy&mdash;neither of which he had quite made up his mind
to accord; but Rose had always flirted with some
one; and when two favourable occasions came to
pass, Heriot was dissuaded by her thoughtlessly
saying:
</p>

<p>
"Now, don't bother yet, my dear old darling
Leslie," for this was her unromantic style ("a jolly
one," the doctor thought it) of addressing him.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Basset would have been blind indeed, had
he not seen the growing intimacy which existed
between them; but he had no idea that matters had
proceeded the length of interchanged promises.
Neither did he observe the ring which Rose now
wore on her engaged-finger&mdash;to wit (for the
information of the uninitiated), the third of the right
hand; and to use a hackneyed phrase, "as fairy" a
finger as ever rejoiced in that pleasant decoration,
for among Rose's chief beauties were her hands,
plump, white, and tiny.
</p>

<p>
Recent events, we have said, prevented explanations,
or any account of what the doctor's prospects
were.
</p>

<p>
"Not much, they are, certainly, dear, dear Rose,"
whispered Heriot, as they sat together in the moonlight,
while the ship still sped before the wind, with
all the reefs out of her topsails.  "I have, one way
and another, but 100<i>l.</i> a year at present.  Had I
more, I would have sought out a snug practice at
home, and not roved about as the surgeon of a
sea-going merchantman."
</p>

<p>
"Then you would not have met me, sir," said
Rose, with waggish asperity.
</p>

<p>
"But I have an uncle, a jolly old fellow, who
loves me well, for my mother was his only sister;
and he loves me for that, perhaps, rather than any
merits of my own."
</p>

<p>
"My poor modest Leslie! well&mdash;and this uncle?"
</p>

<p>
"When he dies&mdash;distant may the day be when
he does so!&mdash;I shall come into 400<i>l.</i> per annum
more.  If at the Isle of France, I could battle the
watch&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Battle what?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it is an old college phrase; I mean, fight
my way into a practice somehow.  With you to
cheer me on, we should do very well.  Then, an
M.D., to get a practice, must have a wife."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"What is the difference between a doctor and a
student?  'There is but a degree between them,'
says some one; but until the student has the
magical letters M.D. added to his name, he is
nothing, and even then he will never get the
<i>passepartout</i> to private houses, unless he has a wife;
and where could I find one dearer, sweeter, more
playful and joyous, more charming than&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Me, you would say?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
Then here, as no one was looking, there followed
a sound which made honest Morrison, who was at
the wheel, "prick up his ears," and laugh quietly
to himself in the moonlight.
</p>

<p>
A ship, of course, does not offer the lover-like
facilities of shady lanes, green thickets, rosy bowers,
or flowery garden walks; but it produces a thousand
occasions for polite attention, amidst its rolling,
tumbling, and pitching about, its extreme discomfort
and peculiarity, which are not given by the solid
and immovable earth, and which the fair dwellers
thereon do not require; but it is, nevertheless, a
very awkward place for indulging in little bits of
osculation&mdash;a phrase for which I refer my fair
reader to her dictionary, if she knows it not.
</p>

<p>
All as yet was quiet in the <i>Hermione</i>.
</p>

<p>
The embers of discord were still smouldering
amid the crew, and the brave ship flew steadily over
the shiny waters of the moonlit sea, her ghostly
shadow falling far across them.
</p>

<p>
Inspired by the calm and beauty of the night,
Morrison, as he leaned thoughtfully over the wheel,
his left hand grasping an upper spoke, and his right
hand a lower one, thinking, perhaps, of his present
shattered prospects, without ship or funds, his
distant home, and his mother's cottage by the Dee,
was singing to himself in a low and plaintive voice.
</p>

<p>
Ethel looked up and listened, though she scarcely
knew the language in which he sang&mdash;a portion of
a sweet little song (by some local poet), and which
he recalled, as we do now, from memory, though
perhaps he may have heard it from his mother, to
whom this brave and honest fellow was attached,
with a devotion that was almost childish.
</p>

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
At that moment the ship's bell clanged.
</p>

<p>
"Stand by to heave the log&mdash;relieve the wheel,"
cried Mr. Foster.
</p>

<p>
After considerable delay Badger, the Yankee,
came slowly shambling aft, to "take his trick" at
the helm, and at the same time the whole crew
came scrambling noisily up the fore-scuttle, where
the watch on deck joined them, and they gathered
in a group about the windlass-bitts.
</p>

<p>
Captain Phillips, Mr. Basset, and Tom Bartelot,
exchanged glances of intelligence and inquiry, while
the second named, inspired by some miserable
foreboding, grew deadly pale.
</p>

<p>
"You have not hurried yourself, mate," said
Morrison.
</p>

<p>
"No; didn't intend to, I reckon," drawled the
Yankee, in his nasal twang.
</p>

<p>
"Why did you not come aft the moment the bell
struck?"
</p>

<p>
"Now, stranger," said Badger, in a tone of mock
expostulation, "d'ye wish your few brains blowed
out with the cook's bellows, or not, that you asks
questions or gives orders here?"
</p>

<p>
"Take the wheel, and take it in silence," said
Morrison, haughtily and sternly; for, although no
mate on board the <i>Hermione</i>, he still felt the habit
of authority strong within him.
</p>

<p>
"I knowed a man at Cape Cod, in the state of
Massachusetts," continued Badger, still delaying,
and speaking slowly through his long nose; "a
Scotchman he was, Mr. Morrison, and the very
moral o' you, with a hook nose and chin, that 'ad
hold a ginger-nut between 'em, who fed sea-gulls
with iron filings, and sold their wings for steel pens.
A 'cute crittur!  But, as I said, he was called a
Scotchman, though I calc'lates he was a Yankee
Jew of Hirish parentage."
</p>

<p>
"If you don't take the wheel, I'll show you the
foretop with a vengeance, my fine fellow," said
Morrison, who could stand anything but sneers at
his country.
</p>

<p>
"You're riled a bit, you air, and your monkey's
getting up.  You've been too well fed, mate,"
drawled Badger.  "I reckons that at home, in your
own little clearin' of a country, you fed upon fir
shavings and cold water.  As for decent junk,
reg'lar old hoss, and plum-duff, I calc'late you never
heerd on 'em afore.  Now, in this here craft, as the
junk's atrowcious, so that even an 'ungry Scotchman
or a blue shark wouldn't look at it, we mean to
have a blow-out to-night in the cabin, and on the
best in the steward's locker too."
</p>

<p>
At that moment Mr. Foster, who, with Joe, had
been heaving the log-line, on hearing words,
came aft, and took the wheel from the hands of
Morrison, who was trembling with suppressed
passion.
</p>

<p>
"Go forward, you rascally carrion," said the
Scotchman, "or, by the heavens above us, I soon
will make blue sharks' meat of you."
</p>

<p>
Badger drew his knife, which gleamed in the
moonlight, but at the same instant he was laid
sprawling on the deck by a blow from the butt-end
of a revolver with which Captain Phillips had armed
Morrison, and which the latter swung at the full
length of his arm and with no unsparing
hand.
</p>

<p>
The cry of rage uttered by Badger was answered
by a yell from the forecastle, and all the crew came
rushing aft, armed with knives, capstan-bars, and
some with pistols, which they had hitherto secreted
in their sea-chests.
</p>

<p>
"Below, ladies, below&mdash;into the cabin, and barricade
the door; quick, quick!" cried Captain Phillips, as
Ethel and Rose, to their astonishment and terror,
were hurried, almost thrust down, the companion-stair.
</p>

<p>
Then several pistol-shots were exchanged,
and a furious struggle instantly took place on
deck.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV.
<br /><br />
HOW THE SHIP BROACHED TO.
</h3>

<p>
At the time of this outbreak the <i>Hermione</i> was, as
we have stated, somewhere about 100 miles off the
mouth of Algoa Bay, and not, as Pedro had calculated,
near the entrance of the Mozambique Channel.
</p>

<p>
Hurried, actually thrust into the cabin by the
hands of Morley Ashton, Dr. Heriot, and others,
Ethel and Rose Basset's terror and astonishment
may be imagined; and greatly were these emotions
increased by the sounds they heard on deck&mdash;the
sudden uproar, the stamping of feet, as of men
engaged in a deadly struggle, the oaths, imprecations,
and occasional discharge of pistols.
</p>

<p>
If Captain Phillips and his friends were disagreeably
surprised to find that the crew possessed some
four or five old ship pistols, which they had hitherto
kept secretly in their sea-chests, they, on the other
hand, were much more disappointed on discovering
that the officers and passengers were fully prepared
for them&mdash;alike forewarned and forearmed; and the
sudden appearance of their pistols and revolvers, as
shot after shot flashed from them in the clear tropical
moonlight, baffled the first rush aft of Pedro and his
brother, for most of the crew, following Hawkshaw's
prudent example, suddenly retreated to the
forecastle, their own peculiar region and quarters.
</p>

<p>
A ball from Pedro's pistol found a harmless victim,
for he shot dead poor Joe the steward.  But at the
same moment a ball from Heriot's revolver grazed
the assassin's left ear, tearing a ring out of it, and
as he rushed back with a bewildered air, at first
believing himself to be shot through the head, Morrison
followed him past the long-boat, showering, with a
capstan-bar, such blows upon him as would have
prostrated any other man than Barradas, who turned
twice upon his pursuer, to whom he opposed in vain
his clubbed pistol and the blade of his Albacete
knife.
</p>

<p>
Poor Mr. Foster, who, as related, had taken the
wheel from Morrison, was now assailed by Badger,
the long Yankee, who had gathered himself up from
the deck, where he had lain sprawling.
</p>

<p>
"Villain!" exclaimed Foster, as he clung to the
spokes of the wheel, which he dared not relinquish
lest the ship should bring to by the lee, and as he
glanced the while with irrepressible agitation at the
upheld knife of the wretch who had grasped his
collar, and held it at the full length of his long, lean,
muscular left arm.  "Villain, would you lift your
knife to me?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, you 'tarnal Britisher, I would choke you like
a weasel," hissed the Yankee through his yellow
teeth.
</p>

<p>
"Do be quiet, Badger," urged Foster, as he
thought of his poor wife and little ones asleep in
their beds at home.  "Have you no pity&mdash;no fear?"
</p>

<p>
"Nayther, I reckon," snivelled the Yankee.
</p>

<p>
"No conscience?" asked Foster, as he felt the
grasp tightening on his collar.
</p>

<p>
"Conscience be d&mdash;&mdash;! as we say in Californy.  I
left my blessed conscience at Cape Horn long ago.
Do you understand that?" said Badger, ferociously.
</p>

<p>
Down came the threatening knife, flashing in the
moonshine.  Foster quitted the wheel and leaped
aside, leaving the collar of his jacket in Badger's
hand; but the point of the blade gave him a severe
slash on the right shoulder.
</p>

<p>
Filled with rage and fear, the second mate broke
away, and plunged down the companion-stair into
the steerage in search of a loaded weapon.  Tom
Bartelot and Mr. Basset followed him, on the same
errand, and the crew, believing that a fight had
begun, once more made a furious rush aft, and thus,
being now minus five of their number, the captain,
with Morley, Heriot, and Noah Gawthrop, found
themselves driven, under a shower of blows and
missiles, past the break of the quarter-deck, and,
ultimately, down below, where they all fell in a heap
upon Mr. Quail, who had turned out, half dressed,
on hearing the row on deck.
</p>

<p>
The last to effect a retreat was Morrison, who had
emptied the six barrels of his revolver without hitting
anyone, but having a capstan-bar, a weapon to which
he was more accustomed, he gave way, step by step,
with his face to the foe; but ultimately he was beaten
down the companion-stair, covered with blood, which
flowed from a wound on his right temple.
</p>

<p>
Fighting inch by inch, there is little doubt that,
at this crisis, the crew might have forced an
entrance to the cabin, especially if some had entered
by the skylight; but now a yell burst from them,
followed by a tremendous crash, and the sound as
of a vast ruin descending on the deck.
</p>

<p>
On Foster abandoning the helm, the ship, which
had been running with a spanking breeze upon her
starboard quarter, broached to; by swinging round,
all her sails were taken aback upon the weather-side,
the sudden strain was more than her spars
could bear, and the fall of a maintopmast, which
had been sprung (<i>i.e.</i>, split) in a recent gale, brought
down the fore and mizzen, with all their yards and
hamper, clean off at the cap of each; and thus, in
a moment the beautiful <i>Hermione</i> was a scene of
as great a ruin and disorder aloft as she was
below.
</p>

<p>
The wilderness of masts, yards, booms, sails,
blocks, and gearing that suddenly descended on
their heads somewhat cooled the ardour of the crew,
and severely injured two or three of them; but
Pedro, a thorough seaman, gave instant orders to
cut, clear away, and coil up, while, rushing to the
wheel, his powerful hands soon made it revolve;
the <i>Hermione's</i> head fell round, once more the
wind came on her quarter, her fore and main
courses, jib, and driver swelled out before it, and
she stood on, but slowly, crippled and shorn of all
her fair proportions.
</p>

<p>
This unexpected misfortune to the mutineers gave
those whom they had for a time vanquished and
driven below time to gather their energies, to reload
their weapons, consider their position and resources,
and to put in requisition those plans originally
formed for the defence of the cabin, their
stronghold, and chiefly of the two Misses Basset.
</p>

<p>
The huge trunk, filled with Mr. Basset's law
books (which fortunately came too late on board to
be shot with other lumber into the hold) was slued
round, and jammed across the cabin-door, which
was further secured by its usual bolts and fastenings.
</p>

<p>
Heriot's pair of pistols, two revolvers, a double-barrelled
fowling-piece, and a sharp hatchet, were
their only weapons, but they had plenty of ammunition,
all made up in cartridges, and so they resolved
to expend it to some purpose.
</p>

<p>
"My ship! my ship! my poor ship! everything
seems to have gone to the devil aloft," groaned
Captain Phillips, in an agony of rage and mortification.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, papa&mdash;dear papa&mdash;what has happened?
What means that dreadful noise on deck?" asked
Ethel and Rose together, as they clung to their
bewildered parent, and saw with alarm their
companions' blanched, flushed, and, in some instances,
blood-stained faces.  Dr. Heriot and Morley Ashton
were both bleeding; the former from a scalp wound,
and the latter from a cut in the lip.  "Oh, papa! tell
us what all this means?"
</p>

<p>
"It means that those infernal villains have risen
to murder us all, ladies; but don't be alarmed for
all that," said Captain Phillips, as he reloaded his
revolver, while a horrible hurly-burly was heard on
deck, where the crew, under the orders of Barradas
the elder, were cutting away or securing so much of
the rigging and spars as might be useful to them,
even to bringing on board the jib-boom, which had
been snapped off at the cap, and hung in the guys
at the end of the whiskers, with the sail drooping
in the water; and all the while they worked amid
a storm of oaths, imprecations, and threats.
</p>

<p>
Among other things cast adrift was the body of
poor Joe, whose pockets were soon investigated&mdash;his
pipe, knife, tobacco-box, and a few coppers
appropriated by Messrs. Sharkey and Bolter&mdash;after
which they cast him over to leeward with as much
indifference as if he had been a dead gull or bit of
"old horse" (<i>i.e.</i>, mouldy junk).
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, overcome with horror and anxiety for
the probable future of his two daughters, poor
Mr. Basset was completely bewildered, and, for a time,
as Captain Phillips said, "had no more pith in him
than an empty sack."  Reclined on the stern-locker,
he pressed his daughters to his breast, keeping, as if
for protection, an arm round each, and he exclaimed
more than once:
</p>

<p>
"Oh God! most merciful of all who show mercy,
protect my poor girls."
</p>

<p>
"He has committed their protection to you, sir,"
said Tom Bartelot, rather impatiently; "only
show a little pluck, like the rest of us, and we shall
weather these villains yet&mdash;aye, work them to an
oil, if they don't fire or sink the ship."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, what new&mdash;what sudden horror is this?"
exclaimed Ethel, wringing her hands, and then
clasping them over her temples, while she turned
her flashing eyes on each in succession.
</p>

<p>
"No sudden 'orror at all, marm," said Noah
Gawthrop, as he tightened his waist-belt, rolled up
the sleeves of his shirt, and looked everywhere
about to spit, but, being in the cabin, restrained the
impulse; "we've known o' the rig they were goin'
to run this long time past."
</p>

<p>
"And Hawkshaw?" asked Ethel, shuddering.
</p>

<p>
"Is a leader among them," replied Morley, applying
a handkerchief to his bleeding lip.  "I never
had a better opportunity for clearing off old scores
than to-night, but somehow he never&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Morley, dear! leave vengeance to other
hands," said Ethel, imploringly.  "Dear, dear
papa," she added, laying her pale brow on
Mr. Basset's cheek, "and so it was this knowledge&mdash;this
horrible dread hanging over you&mdash;that has
given such a mournful tenderness to your voice and
manner for some time past."
</p>

<p>
Her voice, so mellow and thrilling, pierced poor
Basset's heart: he could only answer by his tears.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Morley, love!" said Ethel, in a low,
beseeching voice, "say something to comfort poor
papa."
</p>

<p>
But Morley could only press Mr. Basset's hand in
silence, for, in fact, the poor fellow knew not what
to say.  Rose had tied her little handkerchief round
the doctor's head, and it seemed a more agreeable
remedy than the piece of court-plaster he had hastily
stuck on his scar.
</p>

<p>
To Ethel the watchful, mysterious, solicitous, and
almost sorrowful regard which her father had so
long exhibited towards herself and Rose was quite
accounted for now.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my poor papa&mdash;my own papa!" she exclaimed,
as she threw her arms round his neck, and
nestled with her lovely face close to his, "I have no
fear of death; I would face it courageously&mdash;but
you, and Rose, and Morley.  Oh, I fear that the
blow which kills me may kill you all, too, you love
me so much&mdash;so much more than I have deserved,
dear papa!"
</p>

<p>
"Alas, Ethel! it is not death only that I fear for
you, my sweet and innocent lamb&mdash;and Rose&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Below there, ahoy!" hailed a hoarse voice down
the companion-stair, after the hurly-burly had
somewhat ceased on deck.
</p>

<p>
"It is the voice of that villain, Sharkey," said
Quail.
</p>

<p>
"The murderer of poor Manfredi," added Dr. Heriot.
</p>

<p>
"Below there, you swabs and cork-suckers! have
you all gone to sleep?" hailed the squat
mutineer.
</p>

<p>
"Hollo!" responded Noah, "what do you want,
gallows-bird?"
</p>

<p>
"We want the two girls.  Give them up, and
come on deck.  Tumble up, or it will be the worse
for every man jack of you."
</p>

<p>
"How so, you squab ragamuffin?" asked Captain
Phillips.
</p>

<p>
"We'll drop down the skylight, and make precious
short work with you all," was the hoarse
response.
</p>

<p>
"Come on then, one at a time, or all together&mdash;we
are ready for you," said Captain Phillips.
</p>

<p>
At the same moment the cover of the skylight
was roughly wrenched off, and the chill night wind
poured through the cabin, extinguishing the lamp.
</p>

<p>
A noisy and derisive cheer followed.
</p>

<p>
"Silence fore and aft.  <i>Por vida del demonio
guardad vuestra maldita garulla</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, "Hold your
cursed clack").  Ere long I shall let you know who
is captain of the ship now," cried a deep bass voice
there was no mistaking, and the dark visage of
Pedro Barradas was seen looking down, just as
Heriot led Ethel and Rose to their cabin, when he
whispered to them to take courage, and closed the
door.  "Surrender, and give up your arms, or I
shall set fire to the ship," added Barradas.
</p>

<p>
"What will you gain by doing so?" asked
Captain Phillips, feeling with his fingers if the caps
on his revolver were all right, and taking a full sight
at Pedro's head, which he could see above the rim
of the skylight.
</p>

<p>
"Gain?  Not much, certainly, unless it be
vengeance," replied the Mexican, hoarsely.
</p>

<p>
"Vengeance, you miscreant?  Of what can you,
accuse me?  Surely I never wronged you."
</p>

<p>
"I have nearly lost an ear by the hand of one
among you."
</p>

<p>
"That infliction you brought upon yourself."
</p>

<p>
"If you do not surrender in less than twenty
minutes, I shall fire the ship or scuttle her, and then
shove off with all the boats, leaving you to drown
like a rat in a trap," continued Pedro.
</p>

<p>
"Fool, as well as villain, what purpose would
that serve, but to destroy you all?  Do you know
how far we are from land?" asked the captain.
</p>

<p>
"I know that we are off the mouth of the Mozambique,
and will soon make the land by steering
nor'-nor'-east," replied the mutineer, with a grin.
</p>

<p>
"You are wrong, Pedro Barradas&mdash;by Heaven
you are!  We are only off the Bay of Algoa."
</p>

<p>
"Well, if this wind holds good, and we keep the
ship under her courses and lower studding-sails, we
will make the channel soon enough for our
purpose.  But ha, ha!  Senor Capitano, do you hear
that?" he added, as the sound of axes was heard;
"we are starting the main-hatch to get at the bread
and spirit room, so while you starve here, we shall
drink and be jolly."
</p>

<p>
Captain Phillips groaned as he heard those sounds,
which indicated a further destruction of the ship;
but, taking a sure aim at Pedro, he fired!  The red
flash and sharp report of the pistol were followed by
a yell of rage.
</p>

<p>
"A miss is as good as a mile," cried Badger, the
Yankee; and Pedro, whose cheek was grazed by the
ball, replied by firing into the cabin a random shot,
which lodged in the table; and now, with pistols
and the double-barrelled fowling-piece, there ensued
a regular skirmish, in which our friends, in the dark
seclusion of the cabin, had all the best of it, the
mutineers' mode of warfare being simply a waste
of ammunition, as some four or five of them in
succession continued to dart past the open skylight,
down which they fired at random.
</p>

<p>
Too terrified to weep, Ethel and Rose, clasped in
each other's arms, reclined on their knees against
the side of their bed, with poor old nurse Folgate
grovelling on the carpet beside them.
</p>

<p>
Every instant they heard the sharp reports of the
pistols, and saw the explosions flashing through the
slits in their cabin-door, and all unaccustomed to the
horrors of such an event, they could scarcely believe
that they were not in a dream.
</p>

<p>
Who could imagine that such a scene would occur
on board of a London ship?  But they knew not
the evils that attend a mixed crew.
</p>

<p>
Ignorant of the chances and casualties of voyaging
on the deep, Ethel and Rose, but particularly
the former, was utterly bewildered by this terrible
episode, in which she found herself and friends
involved.  Every shot, every sound, made her heart
leap for her father and her lover.
</p>

<p>
She had pictured to herself how, with Morley by
her side, she would tend for life the declining years
of her only and beloved parent&mdash;tend him as her
mother would have wished her to do.  He, on the
other hand, had hoped to tend, watch, guide, and
see her and Rose far on the chequered highway of
life; but now it seemed as if they were all about to
be torn from each other&mdash;he to suffer a violent and
cruel death, they dishonour and death together.
</p>

<p>
Rose!  Rose!  Poor Ethel's soul shrank within
her at this crisis; but it was more with fear for
dear, merry little Rose than for herself.
</p>

<p>
For some time the exciting skirmish we have
described continued, without anyone being hit,
apparently, either above or below, till Morley felt
someone close by utter a low heavy moan, or sigh,
and then fall suddenly and heavily against him.
</p>

<p>
"Quail&mdash;Mr. Quail," he exclaimed, "is this you?
Are you hurt&mdash;are you hit?"
</p>

<p>
It was poor Mr. Quail who, unable to reply, fell
on the floor of the cabin with blood bubbling from
his mouth.  A lucifer-match was promptly applied
to a candle, a light procured, and the wounded man
was laid on the floor of the captain's state-room,
where Dr. Heriot soon discovered that he was quite
dead, being shot in the head by a common nail, a
proof that the ammunition of the enemy above was
running short.
</p>

<p>
"My God!  Poor Quail&mdash;his wife and little ones!"
exclaimed honest Captain Phillips, with deep
emotion.  "Oh, gentlemen, when will these horrors
end?"
</p>

<p>
A low groan from Mr. Basset alone replied, and
the features of the hapless mate soon grew livid and
ghastly in the flickering light of the candle, as the
damps and the pallor of death stole over them
together.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the crash of axes was heard in the
hold, where already some of the mutineers were
making their way in search of plunder, through the
cargo, hoping to make a breach in the bulkhead
and reach the store where the ship's provisions and
spirits were kept.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXV.
<br /><br />
THE CABIN ATTACKED.
</h3>

<p>
Some of the mutineers now proceeded to throw
various missiles, such as cold shot, ship-buckets,
spare or fallen blocks from aloft, the carpenter's
paint-pots, and so forth, into the ship's cabin; but
only in one instance, when Tom Bartelot received a
contusion on the shoulder, from a wooden marline-spike
flung at random, did any of these take effect,
as our friends lurked securely, pistol in hand, in the
recesses of the upper stern-lockers, in the berths,
and so forth, but none as yet could foresee where
this strife was to end, or who would first come to
terms, before the ship was utterly destroyed, as it
bade fair to be, if this internal war continued.
</p>

<p>
Now the voice of Barradas was heard, giving
orders to cast loose one of the carronades on the
quarter-deck.
</p>

<p>
"What are they about to do with the carronade?"
asked Morley, as he listened intently.
</p>

<p>
"Lower it between decks, to fire through the
bulkhead," suggested the old man-o'-war's man,
Noah.
</p>

<p>
"But have they any round shot?" asked Morley.
</p>

<p>
"We have six rounds for each gun round the
coaming of the main-hatch," said Captain Phillips,
with a very dejected air; "and there are plenty
more in the hold.  Shot are wanted sometimes in
the Indian seas."
</p>

<p>
"And the powder?"
</p>

<p>
"Is all kept in a little magazine near the
taffrail&mdash;the powder required for immediate service, I
mean."
</p>

<p>
"The gun is cast loose," said Bartelot; "if
Noah's idea be their game, it is all up with us,
as they may bowl us to death without danger of
resistance."
</p>

<p>
"Unless when they are at work in the hold, we
make a sally, regain possession of the deck, ship on
the main-hatch, and smother the whole brood!"
said Phillips, with a more savage emotion than ever
before glowed in his kind and jolly breast.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes of painful suspense served to
show that the intentions of the mutineers were
quite different.
</p>

<p>
They were heard to break open the powder magazine,
and load the carronade, which, with loud yells,
and much vociferation, they urged forward to the
rim of the skylight with such force as nearly to
break the framework to pieces, and over it, by using
capstan-bars as levers, they levelled and depressed
the gun, by hoisting up the hind wheels of the
carriage, and driving home quoins under the breach,
till the muzzle was at the angle of forty-five
degrees, and pointed almost towards the bulkhead
of the little cabin in which Ethel and Rose
were weeping and praying.
</p>

<p>
Scarcely a moment was given for question or
consideration, ere Quaco, the black Virginian, came
rushing aft from the caboose, with his sable
cheekbones shining, and his yellow eyes aflame, as he
flourished a red-hot poker, which, as an extempore
match, he applied to the touch-hole.
</p>

<p>
A sudden and blinding flash, with a cloud of
suffocating smoke, filled all the cabin, and there was
a report, or concussion, which made the ship reel to
her centre; a hundred splinters seemed to fly in
every direction, but still no personal danger was
done, though the gun had been charged, not with
round shot, but with a bag of nails, nearly all of
which crashed through the centre of the mahogany
table, and lodged in the deck below.
</p>

<p>
It was not until the first blink of dawn that those
in the cabin knew this; their first idea being, that
a round shot had been sent through the vessel's
bottom; but, mad and furious though the mutineers
were, there was a method in their proceedings, and
to utterly destroy the ship was no part of their
daring plan.
</p>

<p>
Wailing cries of terror came from the ladies'
cabin, and wild and noisy ones from the old nurse;
but no one was hurt there, though all were nearly
stifled by the smoke of the discharge, ere it rose
slowly through the open skylight, and floated away
into the still night air.
</p>

<p>
As the sailors were withdrawing the gun, taking
advantage of its recoil, a volley of pistol-shots from
below whistled about them, and Dr. Heriot, with a
steady aim of the fowling-piece, sent a charge of
buck-shot from both barrels into the face and
shoulders of one fellow, who was immediately borne
forward to the care of Quaco, who, greatly to his
own delight, and with all the mingled fun and
cruelty peculiar to his dingy race, proceeded to
extract them from the bleeding wretch, more
curiously than skilfully, with the prongs of a
carving-fork.
</p>

<p>
They now lashed the gun to its port again, and
retired forward, to consult probably.
</p>

<p>
The ship's bell was no longer struck to call the
watches, but the man at the wheel was regularly
relieved, and, though sometimes exposed to shots
from the cabin, he was never fired on.  Under her
courses and other lower sails, the ship was steered
to the north-east, but her exact course those in the
cabin knew not, as the tell-tale compass had gone to
wreck long ago, under the missiles showered so
liberally through the skylight.
</p>

<p>
By the sounds that came aft from time to time, it
was evident that the crew were eating, drinking, and
making merry in the region of the forecastle; but
the fears of those in the cabin were increased by
this hilarity, which increased the evil chances that
overhung the ship, if a gale came on, and found her
with her crew and rigging in such a state of
disorder, and half the main-hatch open!
</p>

<p>
As day dawned, and the armed lurkers in the
once trim cabin looked around them, its aspect filled
them with exasperation and dismay.
</p>

<p>
The mahogany table, polished to perfection by
poor Joe, was split, and literally torn to pieces by
the contents of the carronade; and below it, the
planks were thickly sown with nails.  All the
missiles we have enumerated, the fire buckets,
double and single blocks, six-pound shot, holystones,
and "prayer-books," &amp;c., encumbered the floor; and
there, cold, white, and ghastly, lay the stiffened
corpse of the unfortunate Mr. Quail, with many a
spot and patch of blood, that had dropped from the
cuts and scars of his companions.
</p>

<p>
Taking advantage of the lull in the hostilities,
Morley, Bartelot, and Noah Gawthrop added all the
missiles that strewed the floor to the barricade
behind the cabin-door; Mr. Foster procured more
caps and ammunition for their fire-arms; Heriot
prepared plasters and bandages for their flesh
wounds and bruises, while Mr. Basset and the
captain took some wine-and-water, with biscuits, to
Ethel, Rose, and their old attendant, as the only
breakfast they had to offer.  After this, unknown to
their fair friends in misfortune, Morrison and Foster
made preparations to launch the mortal remains of
the poor mate into the deep.
</p>

<p>
No time was there then for prayer or homily.
</p>

<p>
The body was simply rolled up in a blanket taken
from his own bed, lashed tight at the head and foot
with a piece of rope.  To the ankles were lashed
four of the shot with which the rascals on deck had
favoured them; and, opening one of the large
windows next the rudder-case, they permitted the
body to drop gently, feet foremost, into the
pale-green water that seethed under the counter.
</p>

<p>
It could be seen sinking slowly far down into the
depths of the morning sea, where it vanished; but
not soon enough to elude the keen instinct of some
Cape pigeons and albatrosses, which gathered, with
ravening beaks and flapping wings, about the place
where the corpse went down, and where but a few
spreading ripples appeared upon the trough of the
rolling waves.
</p>

<p>
By her frothy wake astern, the <i>Hermione</i> seemed
to be going through the water at the rate of six
knots an hour, for the breeze was fresh and steady.
</p>

<p>
Some cold beef from the locker of poor Joe, and
a glass of brandy-and-water, were served round for
breakfast; and none spoke, though all thought of
how they would fare when the last drop of water in
the cabin was gone!
</p>

<p>
So passed the noon.
</p>

<p>
The ill-fated ship still ran north-eastward,
increasing hourly, as Captain Phillips said, her chances
of being overhauled by some homeward-bound ship&mdash;a
chance on which their hopes of succour mainly
depended now.
